Our bromine production operations in Arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program. In addition, through our 50% interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited (“JBC”), a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in Safi, Jordan, we acquire bromine that is originally sourced from the Dead Sea. JBC processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures for our mineral properties. Ketjen Segment Our three main product lines in this segment are (i) Clean Fuels Technologies (“CFT”), which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts (“HPC”) together with isomerization and akylation catalysts; (ii) fluidized catalytic cracking (“FCC”) catalysts and additives; and (iii) performance catalyst solutions (“PCS”), which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives. We offer a wide range of HPC products, which are applied throughout the oil refining industry. Their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur, nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock. In addition, they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes. We continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering HPC products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market. We provide our customers with customized FCC catalyst systems, which assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative, higher-value products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene. Our FCC additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in FCC units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield, such as propylene, and to boost octane in gasoline. Albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs. 4 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Within our PCS product line, we manufacture organometallic co-catalysts (e.g., aluminum, magnesium, and zinc alkyls) used in the manufacture of alpha-olefins (e.g., hexene, octene, decene), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), and electronics. Our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes, epoxies and other engineered resins. There were more than 700 refineries world-wide as of December 31, 2023. We expect to continue to see some less profitable, typically smaller, refineries shutting down and, over the long-term, being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries, with growth concentrated in the Middle East and Asia. Oil refinery utilization continues to return to more typical rates after low refinery utilization during the COVID pandemic periods. Advances in sustainable aviation fuels, petroleum products and renewable diesel are expected to continue. We estimate that there are currently approximately 600 FCC units being operated globally, each of which requires a constant supply of FCC catalysts. In addition, we estimate that there are approximately 4,000 HPC units being operated globally, each of which typically requires replacement HPC catalysts once every one to four years. Competition Our Ketjen segment serves the global market including the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Competition in these markets is driven by a variety of factors. Product performance and quality, price and contract terms, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace. In addition, through our research and development programs, we strive to differentiate our business by developing value-added products based on proprietary technologies. Our major competitors in the CFT catalysts market include Shell Catalysts & Technologies, Advanced Refining Technologies and Haldor Topsoe. Our major competitors in the FCC catalysts market include W.R. Grace & Co., BASF Corporation and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec). In the PCS market, our major competitors include Nouryon, Lanxess AG and Arxada. Raw Materials and Significant Supply Contracts The major raw materials we use in our Ketjen operations include sodium silicate, sodium aluminate, kaolin, aluminum, ethylene, alpha-olefins, isobutylene, toluene and metals, such as lanthanum, molybdenum, nickel and cobalt, most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools, as appropriate, to mitigate price volatility. Human Capital Our main human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe, supported and empowered to do the best work they can do. We believe providing a diverse, equal and inclusive workplace facilitates opportunities for innovation, fosters good decision-making practices, and promotes employee engagement and high productivity across our organization. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 9,000 employees, including employees of our consolidated joint ventures, of whom 3,700, or 41%, are employed in the U.S. and the Americas; 3,300, or 36%, are employed in Asia Pacific; 1,500, or 17%, are employed in Europe; and 500, or 6%, are employed in the Middle East or other areas. Approximately 26% of these employees are represented by unions or works councils. We believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees, and with those unions and works councils. Health and Safety The health and safety of our employees is a part of our core values at Albemarle and is integral to how we conduct business. Our employees, contractors, and visitors follow a comprehensive set of written health and safety policies and procedures at both the corporate and local site levels. We routinely audit ourselves against our policies, procedures and standards, using internal and third-party resources. We also include health and safety metrics in our annual incentive plan for all employees to incentivize our commitment to safety. In 2023, we maintained our Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) occupational injury and illness incident rate of 0.14 for our employees and nested contractors, the same as in 2022. In addition, we provide all employees and their dependents with access to our Employee Assistance Program, which provides free mental and behavioral health resources. 5 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Led by our Vice President, Diversity and Inclusion, we strive to develop inclusion and diversity initiatives and deliver meaningful change in our global organization. A primary focus in our recruiting efforts is to drive greater diversity in our workforce, including higher representation in the professional and managerial job categories. We want to ensure that our workplace reflects the communities in which we live and work. Our recruiting policy includes a requirement that we include individuals from gender or racial minority groups among those we interview for openings at the manager level and above. We seek to provide employees with a desirable workplace that will enable us to attract and retain top talent. We believe employees should be compensated through wages and benefits, based on experience, expertise, performance, and the criticality of their roles in the Company. We also perform an annual review of our pay practices by gender, and in the U.S. by gender and race, to ensure that they are fair and equitable, and not influenced by biased opinions or discrimination. In addition, we have established employee groups, known as Connect groups, to promote an atmosphere of inclusion and encouragement in which every employee’s voice can be heard. These Connect groups provide opportunities for employees to share their backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs, and to use them to benefit others through mentoring and volunteering in the local community, among other activities. Investment in Talent Investing in talent is a critical process for Albemarle because it allows us to be proactive and anticipate key organizational needs for talent and capabilities. This enables us to efficiently and effectively ensure that we have the right talent pipeline to drive Albemarle’s success into the future. We also provide leadership development through performance coaching, comprehensive feedback, plant training including health, safety and environmental topics, and experiential development and mentoring. Our leadership development is a cornerstone to our talent management strategy. We also invest in our people through enhanced training and development opportunities and by seeking to foster a diverse workforce, equitable workplace and an inclusive culture that enables employees to reach their full potential. We also invest in our people through enhanced training and development opportunities and by seeking to foster a diverse workforce, equitable workplace and an inclusive culture that enables employees to reach their full potential. Our incentive program is designed to provide incentives and rewards for achieving Albemarle’s annual goals and objectives. The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board has the overall responsibility of evaluating the performance of the CEO and approving the compensation structure for senior management and other key employees. The Executive Compensation Committee determines performance goals under our incentive program annually to ensure our executive officers execute on short-term financial and strategic initiatives that drive our business strategy and long-term shareholder value. Sales, Marketing and Distribution We have an international strategic account program that uses cross-functional teams to serve large global customers. This program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting post-sale service. Complementing this program are regional Albemarle sales and technical personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers globally. We also utilize commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas when necessary or required by law. Research and Development We believe that in order to generate revenue growth, maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, product and process improvements and specialized customer services. Our research and development efforts support each of our business segments. The objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development. Through research and development, we continue to seek increased margins by introducing value-added products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies. Our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy, avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes. Green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments. Intellectual Property Our intellectual property, including our patents, licenses and trade names, is an important component of our business. As of December 31, 2023, we owned more than 1,600 active patents and more than 550 pending patent applications in key 6 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries strategic markets worldwide. We also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses, and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties. Regulation Our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations, including those under the OSHA. We also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our non-U.S. operations. We devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees, and we maintain an active health, safety and environmental program. We finished 2023 with an OSHA occupational injury and illness incident rate of 0.14 for Albemarle employees and nested contractors, compared to 0.14 in 2022. Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). REACH imposes obligations on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process. Authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the European Union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations. The Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), as amended in June 2016, requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calls for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. This regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other regions, will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Historically, there has been scrutiny of certain brominated fire safety solutions by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries. We manufacture a broad range of brominated fire safety solution products, which are used in a variety of applications. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation. Environmental Regulation We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us. Key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations. In addition, we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury and/or property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment. In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. We are subject to such laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the U.S., and similar foreign and state laws. We may have 7 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries liability as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) with respect to active off-site locations under CERCLA or state equivalents. We have sought to resolve our liability as a PRP at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements, which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs. Because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required, and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability, our estimates could change. Moreover, liability under CERCLA and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several, which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other PRPs has been considered, where appropriate, in estimating our liabilities. Accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve. Our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and, based on information currently available to us, we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations. See “Safety and Environmental Matters” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details. Climate Change and Natural Resources The growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities. We provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies (such as renewable fuels), emission control technologies (including mercury emissions), alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions. As demand for, and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of, alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase, we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation. In addition to potential business opportunities, we acknowledge our responsibility to address the impact of our operations on the environment. We are investing in technology and people to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and air emissions. Albemarle supports the goals of the Paris Agreement to avoid climate change by limiting global warming. Our ambition is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have established greenhouse gas emission targets for each of our businesses, including reducing the scope 1 and 2 carbon-intensity of our Specialties and Ketjen businesses by 35% by 2030, and growing our Energy Storage business in a carbon-intensity neutral manner through 2030. In 2022, we introduced a goal to reduce 90% of our sulfur oxide (SO x ) emissions by 2027. Water is a critical input to Albemarle’s production operations. As water is a scarce resource, we understand the need to responsibly manage our water consumption not only for the preservation of the environment, but also for the viability of our local communities. We are investing in new process technologies to reduce our water footprint and expand capacity sustainably in locations with high water risk. Our goal is to reduce our intensity of freshwater usage by 25% by 2030 in areas of high or extremely high water risk as defined by the World Resources Institute, such as Chile and Jordan. Our businesses are dependent on the availability and responsible management of natural resources. We manage our natural resources to operate efficiently and preserve the environment for our local communities and the world. Our natural resource management includes mineral resource transparency with local communities, governments, regulators and other key stakeholders, as well as partnering with the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance for our lithium production for the assurance of responsible mining. We attempt to maximize the recovery of our extracted minerals and recycle or reuse by-products where possible. In addition, we work with local communities, regulatory agencies and wildlife organizations to preserve and restore land and biodiversity before, during and after all operations commence. Recent Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Divestitures During recent years, we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures, including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses. These acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business, provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries. In addition, we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses that do not fit our high priority business growth profile. The following is a summary of our significant acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures over the last three years. On October 18, 2023, the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited (“MRL”). Under the amended agreements, Albemarle acquired the remaining 40% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with MRL through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50% of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately $380 million in cash, which includes 8 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries $180 million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022. On October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. (“Qinzhou”), for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou’s operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has a designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) and produces battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. On June 1, 2021, we completed the sale of our fine chemistry services (“FCS”) business to W. R. Grace & Co. (“Grace”) for proceeds of approximately $570 million, consisting of $300 million in cash and the issuance to Albemarle of preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of $270 million. As part of the transaction, Grace acquired our manufacturing facilities located in South Haven, Michigan and Tyrone, Pennsylvania. These transactions reflect our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses, maintaining leverage flexibility and returning capital to our shareholders.

Risk Factors You should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information, including the financial information, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business Our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S., with approximately 90% of our net sales to foreign countries. We operate and/or sell our products to customers in approximately 70 countries. We currently have many production, research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the U.S., as detailed in Item 2. Properties. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include the following: • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency; • transportation and other shipping costs may increase, or transportation may be inhibited; • increased cost or decreased availability of raw materials; • increased regulations on, or reduced access to, scarce resources, such as freshwater; • changes in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed, impose new and additional taxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits; • foreign countries in which we do business may adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls; • trade sanctions by or against foreign countries in which we do business could result in our losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries; • unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur; • our agreements with counterparties in foreign countries may be difficult for us to enforce and related receivables may be difficult for us to collect; • compliance with the variety of foreign laws and regulations may be unduly burdensome; 11 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries • compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) as well as anti-money-laundering laws may be costly; • compliance with changing cybersecurity rules and evolving data privacy rules and regulation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, could increase our cost of doing business; • unexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses may occur; • general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries; • our foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes; • termination or substantial modification of international trade agreements may adversely affect our access to raw materials and to markets for our products outside the U.S.; • foreign governments may nationalize or expropriate private enterprises; • increased sovereign risk (such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments) may occur; and • political or economic repercussions from terrorist activities, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability, may occur in certain countries in which we do business. In addition, certain of our operations and ongoing capital projects are in regions of the world such as Asia, the Middle East and South America that are of high risk due to significant civil, political and security instability. Unanticipated events, such as geopolitical changes, could result in a write-down of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects, which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability. Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business. Furthermore, we are subject to rules and regulations related to anti-bribery and antitrust prohibitions of the U.S. and other countries, as well as export controls and economic embargoes, violations of which may carry substantial penalties. For example, export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us or our subsidiaries to fines and enforcement actions and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock. Relating to anti-bribery prohibitions, in September 2023, we finalized agreements with regulatory agencies to resolve self-reported potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; see “ We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws. ” below. Because we conduct substantial operations in China, risks associated with regulatory activity and political and social events in China could negatively affect our business and operating results. In 2023, net sales shipped to China represented 30% of our total net sales. Additionally, we own three production facilities located in China and are in the process of commissioning and starting up a lithium conversion plant in Meishan, China. In addition to the risks described above under “ Our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ”, our operations in China expose us to risks particular to conducting business in that country. For example, over the past several years the U.S. and China have applied tariffs to certain of each other’s exports, which have resulted in shifting trade flows and restrictions on certain sales of goods into China. Additionally, geopolitical disputes (including as a result of China-Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan relations) between the U.S. and China may lead to further restrictions on trade and/or obstacles to conducting business in China. Recently, Australia and China have attempted to improve relations and resolve trade disputes. As we ship a significant portion of our lithium from Australia into China for further processing, tensions or a breakdown in relations between the countries could have a material impact on our operations. Furthermore, the Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality and in response to COVID-19 outbreaks. The Chinese government has also instituted energy intensity and energy consumption targets in a number of provinces in its efforts to reduce energy consumption, resulting in energy quotas and shortages in energy supply that can be disruptive to construction and manufacturing operations. These and other risks may have an adverse effect on our sales to Chinese customers and/or result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some, or all, of our strategic investments in China. In December 2021, the United States adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) which creates a rebuttable presumption that any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Administrative Region of China or that are produced by certain entities are prohibited from importation into the United States and are not entitled to entry. These import restrictions came into effect on June 21, 2022. While we are 12 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries not presently aware of any direct impacts these restrictions will have on its supply chain, the UFLPA may materially and negatively impact our ability to import the goods and products we rely on to manufacture our products and operate our business. Our inability to secure key raw materials, or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy, on a timely basis or at all, including due to climate change, could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations. The long-term profitability of our operations will, in part, depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources, including energy and raw materials. For example, our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce, or otherwise obtain, lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand. If we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials, we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities, which could adversely impact us. Furthermore, other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold, even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly. Increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil, chlorine and metals (including molybdenum and rare earths, which are used in the refinery catalysts business). We generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to do so (or may be delayed in doing so). In addition, raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes. Our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases, or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility, could adversely affect our margins. Competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. We compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, climate-related performance and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry. Competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could negatively affect our margins and profitability. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements, shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors. In addition, Albemarle’s brands, product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the Company’s reputation. Accordingly, the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims, whether with or without merit, against our Company or its products, imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us, or are otherwise disparaging of our Company or its products. Further, our own actions could hurt such brands, product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity. Our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs, and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products. Our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement. Manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products. Our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end markets. As a result, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify, develop, market and, in certain cases, secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all, as may be required to replace or enhance existing products, and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position. In addition, our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications. Changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our 13 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries specialty chemicals unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products. Should a customer decide to use a different material due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements. Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use. Our business, results of operations, cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in developing new products and/or technology, either alone or with third parties, or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. Our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval. Moreover, new products may have lower margins than the products they replace. Furthermore, ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues. The development of non-lithium battery technologies could adversely affect us. The development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues. Current and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input. Alternative materials and technologies are being researched with the goal of making batteries lighter, more efficient, faster charging and less expensive, and some of these could be less reliant on lithium compounds. We cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and on what time horizon. Commercialized battery technologies that use no, or significantly less, lithium could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues. Downturns in our customers’ industries, many of which are cyclical, could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales. Many of our customers are in industries, including the electronics, building and construction, oilfield and automotive industries, are cyclical in nature, or which are subject to secular market downturns or may face adverse effects of evolving regulatory regimes. Historically, cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products, excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. Additionally, certain of these industries are subject to regulatory schemes that may shift with changes in the political climate. The results of elections in the United States (including the November 2024 presidential election) or other countries in which our customers are located may result in consequent changes to these regulatory regimes that could cause a decline within these industries, leading to a diminished demand for our products. A decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our HPC catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals. Our HPC catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products. The effectiveness of HPC catalysts diminishes with use, requiring the HPC catalysts to be replaced, on average, once every one to four years. The sales of our HPC catalysts, therefore, are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the HPC catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter. In addition, the timing and profitability of HPC catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter. Sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions, which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods. In addition, crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals. Regulation, or the threat of regulation, of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. We manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups. For example, over the past decade, there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated fire safety solutions by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries. We manufacture a broad range of brominated fire safety solution products, which are used in a variety of applications to protect people, property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation, or reaction in our markets independent of regulation, that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products. 14 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Agencies in the European Union (“E.U.”) continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated fire safety solutions such as tetrabromobisphenol A and decabromodiphenylethane, both of which we manufacture. Additional government regulations, including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants, could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated fire safety solutions and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated fire safety solutions on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under REACH, which imposes obligations on E.U. manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the E.U. to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process, which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. See “Regulation” in Item 1. Business. Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the E.U. require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations. The TSCA requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. This regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other regions, could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications. Our products enable important performance attributes to our customers’ products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. These risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because, in certain instances, we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees. Also, because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products, we may be requested to participate in, or fund in whole or in part the costs of, a product recall conducted by a customer. For example, some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry. In the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products, we may be asked to participate in, or fund in whole or in part, such a recall. Our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers. Any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers. Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses, any of which could injure our employees or other persons, damage our facilities or other properties, interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation, as well as natural resource extraction, including explosions, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination. In addition, the occurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and 15 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties. Our business could be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The nature of our business, including historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous U.S. and non-U.S. national, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. We currently use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials. We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities. Some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities, including, for example, current and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify. Further, some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation. These regulations affect the manufacturing processes, handling, uses and applications of our products. In addition, our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits. Due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations, our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations. Ongoing compliance with such laws, regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts. Compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing, registration/approval requirements, transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, and storage and disposal of wastes, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, we may be subject to carbon pricing or taxation proposals in some jurisdictions where we operate. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements. Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters. Furthermore, environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs. We may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested. In connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters, such as certain breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain environmental matters. With respect to environmental matters, the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws. We may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments. Further, we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser. Such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2021, we agreed to pay $665 million to settle claims related to a legacy Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (“Rockwood”) business sold to a third party prior to our acquisition of Rockwood in 2015. At several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist (including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated), we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators; however, in the event we make a claim, the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding, or not have the financial capacity to fulfill, its indemnity obligation. If our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective, our accrual and/or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially. 16 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws, and in the past have paid fines in order to resolve self-reported potential violations of such laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar foreign anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our joint ventures), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In September 2023, following an internal investigation and voluntary self-reporting of potential violations of the FCPA, we finalized agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC relative to improper payments made, prior to 2018, by third-party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business (now Ketjen).  In connection with this resolution, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and an administrative resolution with the SEC, pursuant to which we paid a total of $218.5 million in aggregate fines, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest. We also agreed to certain ongoing compliance reporting obligations. We are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business. We are subject to government regulation in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs, including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses, or require changes in business practice, in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business. Our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities. Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights, or being accused of infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Protection of our proprietary processes, methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of the U.S. and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold, as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of some countries, or their enforcement, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies. Additionally, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued patent. If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. We also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future. We endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us. However, we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all. Our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers, which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers. We could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products partially or completely, pay to use the technology of others, stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely. Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of 17 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries infringement suits. We may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products. We also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other means, such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft. Our inability to acquire or develop additional lithium reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability. Our lithium reserves will, without acquiring or developing additional reserves, decline as we continue to extract these raw materials. Accordingly, our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract. Exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature. Exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably. Once a site with potential resources is discovered, it may take several years of development until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions. We utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as, but not limited to, changes in volumes, grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed; changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force; the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made; adverse geotechnical conditions; availability, supply and cost of water and power; fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates; delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development; changes in royalty agreements, laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes; and weather or severe climate impacts. For our existing operations, we utilize geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or social, political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. In addition, it cannot be assumed that any part or all of the inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. See Item 2. Properties, for a discussion and quantification of our current mineral resources and reserves. There is risk to the growth of lithium markets. Our lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium batteries and the growth in demand for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. As such, our business results inherently depend on decarbonization of the global economy. To the extent that such development, adoption, decarbonization and growth do not occur in the volume and/or manner that we contemplate, including for reasons described under the heading “The development of non-lithium battery technologies could adversely affect us,” above, the long-term growth in the markets for lithium products may be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Demand and market prices for lithium will greatly affect the value of our investment in our lithium resources and our revenues and profitability generally. Our ability to successfully develop our lithium resources and generate a return on investment will be affected by changes in the demand for and market price of lithium-based end products, such as lithium hydroxide. The market price of these products can fluctuate and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, primarily world supply and demand. Such 18 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns, various political developments and macro-economic circumstances. In addition, the price of lithium products is impacted by their purity and performance. We may not be able to effectively mitigate against such fluctuations; although some of our long-term agreements include higher pricing, we are also party to index-referenced and variable-priced contracts. In 2023, lithium prices significantly decreased by approximately 75% to 85% from their high in January 2023 to the end of the year, which adversely impacted our financial results. High volatility or further declines in the lithium prices could have a material and adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our Lithium business and on our company generally. In addition, a further decrease in lithium prices may lead to additional inventory valuation charges in the valuation period prior to when the goods are sold, such as the $604.1 million charge recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023 to reduce the value of certain spodumene and finished goods to their net realizable value. Following the Wodgina acquisition in 2019, the Wodgina mine idled production of spodumene until market demand supported bringing the mine back into production. We have since resumed spodumene concentrate production at the Wodgina mine in 2022, but there are no assurances that we will not idle production at the Wodgina mine or one of our other mines in the future due to lack of market demand or for other reasons. If we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team. In light of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, because of our reliance on our senior management team, the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. In addition, the U.S. and other regions in which we operate are experiencing an acute workforce shortage for skilled workers, which in turn has created a hyper-competitive wage environment that may impact our ability to attract and retain employees. Some of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 9,000 employees, including employees of our consolidated joint ventures. Approximately 26% of these employees are represented by unions or works councils. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees, a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs. Our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures. We currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan. In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture. Also, differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 19 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Risks Related to Our Financial Condition Our required capital expenditures can be complex, may experience delays or other difficulties, and the costs may exceed our estimates. Our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment, facilities and properties, and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment, facilities and properties. Execution of these capital expenditures can be complex, and commencement of production requires start-up, commission and certification of product quality by our customers, which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities. Construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such projects and our ability to estimate future demand for our products. In addition, our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations. Future capital expenditures may be significantly higher, depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines, and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry. We may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets. We will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or raise additional equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures. A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result, our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. In addition, there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us. Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business. Our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants. These covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility. The failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including cross-defaults to other debt facilities. See “Financial Condition and Liquidity—Long-Term Debt” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing, the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations. Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing, limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. 20 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates, and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. The downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Australian Dollar, Chilean Peso and Japanese Yen. Exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. With respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations, for the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 28% of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency-denominated debt outstanding. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency. Our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks. Significant or prolonged periods of higher interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Interest rates may have a direct impact on our business to the extent we borrow under our unsecured credit facility, utilize our commercial paper program, or incur other forms of variable rate indebtedness or new indebtedness based on current interest rates. Borrowings under our unsecured credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 0.910% to 1.375%, depending on the Company’s credit rating. In May 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes from time-to-time in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of up to $1.5 billion (up from $750 million prior to the May 2023 increase). In a rising interest rate environment, debt financing will become more expensive and may have higher transactional and servicing costs. For example, our interest expense on debt instruments in fiscal 2023 increased compared to fiscal 2022 driven by an increase in our weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt. Although we may take steps to limit our exposure to variable rate debt, if interest rates remain relatively high or increase in the future, we could see increases in our borrowing costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Inflationary trends in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy, could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials and in transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary environment. If we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our products to offset inflationary cost trends, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations, and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. Our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect higher input costs is critical to maintain and grow our sales. Increases in prices of our products to customers or the impact of the broader inflationary environment on our customers and may lead to declines in demand and sales volumes. Further, we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, especially if our competitors are able to more successfully adjust to such input cost volatility. Increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or purchase less of our products, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations. Changes in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results. Our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world. Recent changes in the U.S. include the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”), enacted August 16, 2022, which, among other items, imposes a 15% alternative minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion and introduces or extends a number of tax credits to promote clean energy development. We continue to monitor the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act and other regulatory 21 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries developments on our financial condition, operating results, and income tax rate. Currently, the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the U.S. We have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-U.S. subsidiaries, because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense, which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays or rulings, changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. Recent developments, including the European Commission’s investigations on illegal state aid, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities. The OECD developed a global tax framework inclusive of a 15% global minimum tax under the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (“Pillar Two”). On December 15, 2022, the Council of the E.U. formally adopted the OECD’s framework to achieve a coordinated implementation amongst E.U. Member States consistent with E.U. law. The E.U.’s Pillar Two Directive has an effective date of January 1, 2024 for certain aspects of the directive, with the remaining aspects effective on January 1, 2025. Other major jurisdictions are actively considering and implementing changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. We have assessed this framework and determined, based upon available guidance, that these changes could have a material impact to our results of operations, but it is dependent on our mix of earnings beginning in 2024. Any future changes in OECD guidance or interpretations, including local country tax legislative changes thereof could impact our initial assessment; therefore, we will continue to monitor and refine our assessment as further guidance is made available. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. It is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and U.S. deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases) to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations, a deferred tax liability may need to be established. Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings. We are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings, which may be material in the future. The outcome of proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations, leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables. Legal and regulatory proceedings, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct, may divert management’s attention and other resources, inhibit our ability to sell our products, result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, and otherwise negatively affect our business. 22 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements, events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business. We have several defined benefit pension plans around the world, including in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Belgium and Japan. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries. In previous years, we have made voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. We anticipate approximately $11 million of required cash contributions during 2024 for our defined benefit pension plans. Additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2024 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns, interest rates, and legislative changes. The amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly. These contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business. Further, an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets, our results of operations, our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity. Our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations. Any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity. We cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. We believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong, long-term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance, reduce costs, and support new product development. To satisfy these growing customer requirements, our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions. As part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future. Our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures. The process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include: • potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; • unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures and litigation arising from acquisitions; • unforeseen adjustments, charges and write-offs; • problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities; • unexpected losses of customers of, or suppliers to, the acquired business; • difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses’ standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; • in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; • variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting; • inability to coordinate new product and process development; • loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; • diversion of management’s attention from other business matters; and • challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. 23 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Any such integration failure could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition, but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration. This could cause significant diversion of management’s attention and out-of-pocket expenses. We may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness related to acquisitions. We have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions. A part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth. Our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants. In addition, the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. As a result, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions. Any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations (whether or not arising from acquisitions) could have important consequences and risks for us, including: • reducing flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses, the competitive environment and the industries in which we operate, and to technological and other changes; • lowering credit ratings; • reducing access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future operating and capital expenses and for general corporate purposes; • to the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates; • reducing funds available for operations, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and other activities; and • creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on October 31 of each year, or more frequently if required. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition. General Risk Factors Adverse conditions in the economy, and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers, suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A global, regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products, negatively impacting our operating results. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national, regional and global economies, including economic downturns (including credit market tightness, which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers, suppliers and other business partners), declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates. Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing, leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products, and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Also, it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. Finally, any such adverse conditions in the economy and financial markets could make it difficult for us to raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms. 24 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches, information technology system failures, or network disruptions. We and our third-party service providers have been and will continue to be subject to advanced and persistent threats in the areas of information and operational technology security and fraud, which may become more sophisticated over time. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, as well as work with third-party service providers on detection of, and alerting us to, any incidents affecting us, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that a cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, customers’ or licensees’ confidential or personal information, we may incur liability as a result. The devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results. In addition, risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, or vulnerabilities in our third-party service providers’ systems, could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, we face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. Finally, we can provide no assurance that the networks and systems that our third-party service providers have established or use will be effective. Although we have implemented certain processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products. Chemical-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations (and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future) that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities, which increase our overhead expenses. We are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the U.S. We believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered. We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous. Bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities, like Washington, D.C., could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations. Broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program (“CFATS Program”), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the U.S. DHS has enacted rules under the CFATS Program that impose comprehensive federal security regulations for high-risk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest. These rules establish risk-based performance standards for the security of the U.S.’s chemical facilities. They require covered chemical facilities to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments, which identify facility security vulnerabilities, and to develop and implement Site Security Plans, which include measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards. We have implemented all necessary changes to comply with the rules under the CFATS Program to date, however, we cannot determine with certainty any future costs associated with any additional security measures that DHS may require. The occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general, and the markets for our products in particular. The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could 25 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive. National or international disputes, political instability, terrorism war or armed hostilities, could impact our results of operations. Geo-political events, national or international disputes, political instability, terrorism or other acts of violence, war or armed hostilities may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy. Such geo-political instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct business in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cybersecurity breaches arising from geo-political instability. Any such events may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to capital markets, raw materials, energy and freight costs, our supply chain, information security and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, energy shortages, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets.We currently do not sell our products into Russia nor have assets or any operations in the country, however, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict’s current scope could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to its impact in the countries in which we do conduct business. At this time, the current situation in the Middle East has resulted in our business operations continuing as normal with some shipping and raw material delays. However, the geo-political climate remains volatile and a disruption could occur at any time, potentially causing a financial impact to our business. Natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme heat, storms or earthquakes; pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; or other unanticipated catastrophes at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers, or customers do business could cause interruptions in our operations. Historically, major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast for many of our customers and certain of our suppliers of raw materials, which has had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products. Our operations in Chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes, and our operations in Asia could be subject to weather events such as typhoons. A global or regional pandemic or similar outbreak in a region in which we or our key partners, customers, or suppliers operate could disrupt business, depending on factors including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, government restrictions on businesses and individuals, impact on demand for our products, impact on the supply chain network, and the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we do business. If similar or other weather events, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events occur in the future, they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy. Our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures. We maintain property, business interruption, casualty, and other insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and coverage limits. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. We are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. We may be exposed to certain physical, transitional, regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. Climate change includes changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures, among others. For example, there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the Dead Sea, from which our joint venture, JBC, produces bromine. Climate changes and unprecedented weather events may pose a risk to business operations in vulnerable areas. In some regions including China, 26 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries extreme heat and drought conditions could also impact the availability of hydropower resulting in decreased production and/or increased costs. Storms could cause business interruptions, incur additional restoration costs, and impact product availability and pricing. Disruptions to the global supply chain due to climate related impacts or geopolitical events are possible and exist as external risk factors that we can respond to but not control. These events could limit the supply of key raw materials to us, or could have significant impacts to pricing. We work with numerous independent suppliers to mitigate lack of availability from a single supplier, however in some cases products with limited numbers of suppliers may become difficult to obtain. Potential transition risks related to climate change include increased battery regulation, potential loss of customers due to climate-related performance, and increased costs related to carbon pricing. Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Potentially, additional U.S. federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations. In addition, we have operations in the E.U., Brazil, China, Japan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, which have implemented, or may implement, measures to achieve objectives under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”), which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Significant regional or national differences in approaches to environmental laws and regulations could affect us disproportionately compared to our competitors and result in a competitive disadvantage to us. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. We may have heightened credit risk due to our exposure to climate risks. While certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control, compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation, market trends or litigation on the Company is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to meet environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders, regulators and the public in general on ESG matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations, regulatory obligations, economic conditions and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Meeting the ESG goals we have set and publicly disclosed will require significant resources and expenditures, and we may face pressure to make commitments, establish additional goals, and take actions to meet them beyond our current plans. If customers and potential customers are dissatisfied with our ESG goals or our progress towards meeting them, then they may choose not to buy our products and services, which could lead to reduced revenue, and our reputation could be harmed. In addition, we could experience reduced revenue and reputational harm if we are targeted by anti-ESG groups or influential individuals who disagree with our public positions on social or environmental issues. Additionally, lawsuits or regulatory actions based on allegations that certain public statements regarding ESG-related matters by companies are false and misleading “greenwashing” campaigns could adversely impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. We may be unable to satisfactorily meet evolving standards, regulations and disclosure requirements related to ESG. Such matters can affect the willingness or ability of investors to make an investment in our Company, as well as our ability to meet regulatory requirements, including proposed rules related to greenhouse gas emissions. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations, additional regulations and industry standards or achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. 27 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. NONE Item 1C. Cybersecurity. Albemarle recognizes the importance of maintaining the security and integrity of our information systems and the data we collect, process, and store. We have implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (“CSF”). As such, we map the CSF to corresponding legal, regulatory, and industry security practices, which guide our global policies and procedures to prevent, identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity threats and incidents. Our cybersecurity program is overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), and it is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management framework and thus is factored into our long-term strategy and business continuity plans. Our CISO is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional and a Certified Ethical Hacker with more than 25 years of experience as a cybersecurity professional working extensively with critical infrastructure partners to reduce cyber risk within traditional and operation technology networks. Our leadership team receives monthly updates on security operations and governance functions as part of monthly Information Security Council meetings led by our CISO. The Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees information security matters and the Company’s cybersecurity program. Our Chief Information Officer and CISO report on cybersecurity related matters, including the status of ongoing initiatives, incident reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, and emerging threats in global cybersecurity, on a periodic and as needed basis to the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee offers guidance on certain matters and approval for material initiatives. In addition, the full Board of Directors is updated on cybersecurity matters as needed depending on the nature and materiality of a cybersecurity matter. All information assets are inventoried, classified, prioritized, and protected based on the respective risk, with appropriate cybersecurity controls applied to each. We have also implemented and maintain a documents management program which governs the classification, protection, and use of sensitive company data within the Albemarle environment. All business-requested technologies and third-party service providers must successfully complete a thorough cybersecurity and contract review before being approved for use, after which they become part of our continuous risk monitoring program. Cybersecurity risks and potential costs are evaluated as a part of business operations, and the respective business impacts are continuously assessed to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities. We engage a third-party global firm to conduct an annual cyber assessment using the CSF, and we engage external vendors to validate our security controls and procedures through periodic penetration tests. We follow a zero-trust architecture approach and enforce the use of multi-factor authentication and virtual private network technologies for all external access to provide secure support for our remote workers. Information security training is part of our compliance program, and includes mandatory security training for new hires, mandatory yearly security training for all staff, and regular phishing tests to raise awareness and response actions. Our team of cybersecurity professionals are responsible for maintaining a global information systems environment that focuses on least privilege, least functionality, and network segmentation throughout the landscape using a layered approach (i.e. a defense-in-depth strategy). This includes a security operations center and cybersecurity engineers who provide 24/7 network monitoring. As further discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, a material cybersecurity incident could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results and condition. To date we have not had a cybersecurity incident that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial results or business operations; however, we monitor and work to continuously improve our cybersecurity program as threats become more frequent and sophisticated. All our manufacturing sites have formal business continuity plans that address site-specific priority responses, each determined through business impact analyses that integrate within our overall corporate crisis management response plan and enterprise risk management program. We also conduct frequent drills and exercises of formal cyber response procedures and business continuity plans. Lessons learned from the outcomes of these exercises are then assessed and used to inform and improve our formal cyber response procedures and business continuity plans. 28 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries In the event of, or the reasonably likely threat of, a cybersecurity incident, our cyber response procedures outline the tasks and timeline for the escalation of the incident to key members of the organization, including the information technology team, business unit management, and Albemarle executives and other key management. These individuals would participate in a special event management plan activation meeting to gain an understanding as to how the incident was detected and analysis of the incident. Each member of management involved would be responsible for assessing the risks, impact, and necessary response as determined by their role. The procedures include key considerations each manager should consider in their assessment as well as their responsibility for involvement in remediation efforts and post-incident strategic reviews. Specific legal and executive role procedures include the assessment of necessary internal communication and external reporting. The Chief Executive Officer, with the support of other executive officers, is responsible for approval of incident reporting and informing and updating the Board of Directors. Item 2. Properties. We operate globally, with our principal executive offices located in Charlotte, North Carolina and regional shared services offices located in Budapest, Hungary and Dalian, China. Each of these properties are leased. We and our affiliates also operate regional sales and administrative offices in various locations throughout the world, which are generally leased. We believe that our production facilities, research and development facilities, and sales and administrative offices are generally well maintained, effectively used and are adequate to operate our business. During 2023, the Company’s manufacturing plants operated at approximately 75% capacity, in the aggregate. Set forth below is information regarding our production facilities operated by us and our affiliates. Additional details regarding our significant mineral properties can be found below the table.

Mineral Properties Set forth below are details regarding our mineral properties operated by us and our affiliates, which have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K issued by the SEC. The following terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K: Mineral resource - a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Measured mineral resource - that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Indicated mineral resource - that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Inferred mineral resource - that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Mineral reserve - an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person , can be the basis of an economically viable project. Proven mineral reserve - the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource . Probable mineral reserve – the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource . Cutoff grade - the grade ( i.e. , the concentration of metal or mineral in rock) that determines the destination of the material during mining. For purposes of establishing “prospects of economic extraction,” the cut-off grade is the grade that distinguishes material deemed to have no economic value from material deemed to have economic value. Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral resources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person (“QP”) that the mineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project. Except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources are estimates based on limited geological evidence and sampling and have a too 30 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be converted to a mineral reserve. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be the basis of an economically viable project, that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category, or that all or any part of the mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. See risk factor - “Our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability,” in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Overview At December 31, 2023, we had the following mineral extraction facilities: Location Business Segment Ownership % Extraction Type Stage Australia Greenbushes Energy Storage 49% Hard rock Production Wodgina (a) Energy Storage 50% Hard rock Production Chile Salar de Atacama (b) Energy Storage 100% Brine Production Jordan Safi (b) Specialties 50% Brine Production United States Kings Mountain, NC Energy Storage 100% Hard rock Development Magnolia, AR (b) Specialties 100% Brine Production Silver Peak, NV (b) Energy Storage 100% Brine Production (a)    Production of spodumene concentrate at the Wodgina mine resumed in the second quarter of 2022 after it had been idled in 2019, following the acquisition of our interest in Wodgina. On October 18, 2023, we completed the restructuring of our MARBL joint venture, which reduced our ownership percentage of Wodgina from 60% to 50%. (b)    Site includes on-site, or otherwise near-by, exclusive conversion facilities. See individual property disclosure below for further details. Aggregate annual production from our mineral extraction facilities is shown in the below table. Amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on ownership percentages noted above and are shown in thousands of metric tonnes of 31 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries lithium metal and bromine production. Lithium and bromine is extracted as brine or hard rock concentrate at the extraction facilities. These are then further converted into various compounds and products at on-site processing facilities or other conversion facilities owned by Albemarle around the world. In addition, the brine or concentrate can be used by tolling entities for further processing.

Conversion to LCE is 0.1878 metric tonne of lithium metal to 1 metric tonne of LCE. (b)    Production from Greenbushes represents 49% of production of the Greenbushes mine, which is attributable to the Company’s interest in the Windfield joint venture. (c)    Production of spodumene concentrate at the Wodgina mine resumed in the second quarter of 2022 after it had been idled in 2019. Production amounts presented from Wodgina represent 60% of production of the Wodgina mine which is attributable to the Company’s interest in the MARBL joint venture until October 18, 2023, when we reduced our ownership percentage to 50% following the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with MRL. The above production amounts reflect that change in ownership percentage beginning on October 18, 2023. (d)    The Salar de Atacama operation also produces potash (potassium chloride), bichofite, halite and sylvinite as byproducts. However, the Company does not consider production of these byproducts as material to the economics of the operation. (e)    Production from Safi represents the 50% production by the Jordan Bromine Project, which is attributable to the Company’s interest in the JBC joint venture. (f)    The Safi operation also produces potassium hydroxide (“KOH”) as a byproduct. However, the Company does not consider production of this byproduct as material to the economics of the operation. (g)    In addition, elemental sulfur and sodium hydrosulfide solution (“NaHS”) are manufactured from the sour gas produced by the Magnolia operation. However, the Company does not consider these products as material to the economics of the operation. See individual property disclosure below for further details regarding mineral rights, titles, property size, permits and other information for our significant mineral extraction properties. The extracted brine or hard rock is processed at facilities on location (as described below) or processed, or further processed, at other facilities throughout the world. The following table provides a summary of our mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, at December 31, 2023. The below mineral resource amounts are rounded and shown in thousands of metric tonnes. Where applicable, the amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on ownership percentages noted. The relevant technical information supporting mineral resources for each material property is included in the “Material Individual Properties” section below, as well as in the technical report summaries filed as Exhibits 96.1 to 96.6 to this report. 32 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Measured Mineral Resources Indicated Mineral Resources Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources Inferred Mineral Resources Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Lithium - Hard Rock: Australia Greenbushes (a) — — 37,100 1.48% 37,100 1.48% 5,800 1.19% Wodgina (b) — — 8,800 1.31% 8,800 1.31% 81,700 1.12% United States Kings Mountain, NC — — 46,816 1.37% 46,816 1.37% 42,869 1.10% Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Lithium - Brine: Chile Salar de Atacama 471 2,390 363 1,943 834 2,195 237 1,617 United States Silver Peak, NV 14 153 36 144 50 146 90 121 (a)    Through our Windfield joint venture, we own a 49% interest in the Greenbushes mine. We are therefore reporting 49% of Greenbushes’ mineral resources. (b)    Through our MARBL joint venture, we own a 50% interest in Wodgina. We are therefore reporting 50% of Wodgina’s mineral resources. The feedstock for the Safi, Jordan site, owned 50% by Albemarle through its JBC joint venture, is drawn from the Dead Sea, a nonconventional reservoir owned by the nations of Israel and Jordan. As such, there are no specific resources owned by JBC, but Albemarle’s joint venture partner, Arab Potash Company (“APC”) has exclusive rights granted by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to withdraw brine from the Dead Sea and process it to extract minerals. The measured resource of bromide ion attributable to Albemarle’s 50% interest in its JBC joint venture is estimated to be approximately 175.69 million metric tonnes. JBC is extracting approximately 1 percent of the bromine available in Jordan’s share of the Dead Sea. Bromide concentration in the Dead Sea is estimated to average approximately 5,000 parts per million (“ppm”). There are no mineral resource estimates at the Magnolia, AR bromine extraction site. All bromine mineral accumulations of economic interest and with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction within the Magnolia production lease area are either currently on production or subject to an economically viable future development plan and are classified as mineral reserves. The following table provides a summary of our mineral reserves at December 31, 2023. The below mineral reserve amounts are rounded and shown in thousands of metric tonnes. The amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on ownership percentages noted above. The relevant technical information supporting mineral reserves for each material property is included in the “Material Individual Properties” section below, as well as the in the technical report summaries referenced in Exhibits 96.1 to 96.6 to this report. 33 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Proven Mineral Reserves Probable Mineral Reserves Total Mineral Reserves Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Lithium - Hard Rock (a): Australia Greenbushes (b) — — 71,800 1.82% 71,800 1.82% Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Lithium - Brine: Chile Salar de Atacama 321 2,354 210 2,050 531 2,226 United States Silver Peak, NV 14 94 54 95 68 95 Bromine: United States Magnolia, AR (c) 2,706 611 3,317 (a)    The Wodgina mine is at an initial assessment level, and as a result, contains no mineral reserves. Mineral reserve estimates are not applicable for the Kings Mountain site. (b)    Through our Windfield joint venture, we own a 49% interest in the Greenbushes mine. We are therefore reporting 49% of Greenbushes’ mineral reserves. (c)    The concentration of bromine at the Magnolia site varies based on the physical location of the field and can range over 6,000 mg/L. All bromine reserves reported by Albemarle for the JBC project are classified as proven mineral reserves. The mineral reserve estimate for the Safi, Jordan bromine site attributable to Albemarle’s 50% interest in its JBC joint venture is approximately 2.07 million metric tonnes of bromine from the Dead Sea. This estimate is based on the time available under the concession agreement with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the processing capability of the JBC plant. As only approximately one percent of the available resource is consumed from the Dead Sea, as noted above, the reserve estimate is based on the amount the JBC plant can produce over until the end of 2058, when the APC concession agreement ends. Bromine concentration used to calculate the reserve estimate from the Dead Sea was approximately 7,645 ppm based on historical pumping. Mineral resource and reserve estimates were prepared by a QP with an effective date provided in the individual technical report summaries referenced in Exhibits 96.1 to 96.6 to this report. Differences between the amounts in the table above and those amounts in the technical report summaries represent estimated depletion from the effective date of the report until December 31, 2023, and in the case of Wodgina, the decrease in ownership interest to 50% from 60%. Our mineral resource and reserve estimates are based on many factors, including the area and volume covered by our mining rights, assumptions regarding our extraction rates based upon an expectation of operating the mines on a long-term basis and the quality of in-place reserves. Internal Controls The modeling and analysis of our mineral resources and reserves was developed by our site personnel and reviewed by several levels of internal management, as well as the QP for each site. The development of such resources and reserves estimates, including related assumptions, were prepared by a QP. When determining resources and reserves, as well as the differences between resources and reserves, management developed specific criteria, each of which must be met to qualify as a resource or reserve, respectively. These criteria, such as demonstration of economic viability, points of reference and grade, are specific and attainable. The QP and management agree on the reasonableness of the criteria for the purposes of estimating resources and reserves. Calculations using these criteria are reviewed and validated by the QP. 34 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Estimations and assumptions were developed independently for each significant mineral location. All estimates require a combination of historical data and key assumptions and parameters. When possible, resources and data from public information and generally accepted industry sources, such as governmental resource agencies, were used to develop these estimations. Each site has developed quality control and quality assurance (“QC/QA”) procedures, which were reviewed by the QP, to ensure the process for developing mineral resource and reserve estimates were sufficiently accurate. QC/QA procedures include independent checks (duplicates) on samples by third party laboratories, blind blank/standard insertion into sample streams, duplicate sampling, among others. In addition, the QPs reviewed the consistency of historical production at each site as part of their analysis of the QC/QA procedures. See details of the controls for each site in the technical summary reports filed as Exhibits 96.1 to 96.6 to this report. We recognize the risks inherent in mineral resource and reserve estimates, such as the geological complexity, the interpretation and extrapolation of field and well data, changes in operating approach, macroeconomic conditions and new data, among others. The capital, operating and economic analysis estimates rely on a range of assumptions and forecasts that are subject to change.  In addition, certain estimates are based on mineral rights agreements with local and foreign governments. Any changes to these access rights could impact the estimates of mineral resources and reserves calculated in these reports. Overestimated resources and reserves resulting from these risks could have a material effect on future profitability. Material Individual Properties Greenbushes, Australia The Greenbushes mine is a hard rock, open pit mine (latitude 33° 52´S, longitude 116° 04´ E) located approximately 250km south of Perth, Western Australia, 90km southeast of the port of Bunbury, a major bulk-handling port in the southwest of Western Australia. The lithium mining operation is near the Greenbushes townsite located in the Shire of Bridgetown- 35 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Greenbushes. Access to the Greenbushes Mine is via the paved South Western Highway between Bunbury and Bridgetown to Greenbushes Township and via the paved Maranup Ford Road to the Greenbushes Mine. Lithium production from the Greenbushes Mine has been undertaken continuously for more than 20 years. Modern exploration has been undertaken on the property since the mid-1980s, first by Greenbushes Limited, then by Lithium Australia Ltd and in turn by Sons of Gwalia prior to the acquisition of Greenbushes by Talison in 2007. Initial exploration focused largely on tantalum, with the emphasis changing to lithium from around 2000. In 2014, Rockwood acquired a 49% ownership interest in Windfield, which owns 100% of Talison, from Sichuan Tianqi Lithium Industries Inc. This 49% ownership in Windfield was assumed by Albemarle in 2015 as part of the acquisition of Rockwood. We purchase lithium concentrate from Windfield, and our investment in the joint venture is reported as an unconsolidated equity investment on our balance sheet. About 55% of the tenements held by Talison are covered by Western Australia’s State Forest, which is under the authority of the Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. The majority of the remaining land is private land that covers about 40% of the surface rights. The remaining ground comprises crown land, road reserves and other miscellaneous reserves. The tenements cover a total area of approximately 10,000 hectares and include the historic Greenbushes tin, tantalum and current lithium mining areas. See section 3 of the Greenbushes technical report summary, filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this report, for a listing of tenements held by the Greenbushes site. Talison holds the mining rights for all lithium minerals on these tenements. The operating open pit lithium mining and processing plant area covers approximately 3,500 hectares comprising three mining leases. All lithium mining activities, including tailings storage, processing plant operations, open pits and waste rock dumps, are currently carried out within the boundaries of the three mining leases plus two general purpose leases. In order to keep the granted tenements in good standing, Talison is required to maintain permits, make an annual contribution to the statutory Mining Rehabilitation Fund and pay a royalty on concentrate sales for lithium mineral production as prescribed under the Mining Act 1978 in Western Australia. There are no private royalties that apply to the Greenbushes property. Talison continues to review all tenements on an annual basis and ensures compliance with relevant regulatory requirements and fees for maintenance of these tenements. The Greenbushes pegmatite deposit consists of a primary pegmatite intrusion (Central Lode) with a smaller, sub-parallel pegmatite to the east (Kapanga). The primary intrusion and its subsidiary dikes and pods are concentrated within shear zones within a metamorphic belt consisting of granofels, ultramafic schists and amphibolites. The pegmatites are crosscut by mafic dolerite dikes. The Central Lode pegmatite is over 3 kilometers long (north by northwest), up to 300 meters wide (normal to dip), strikes north to north-west and dips moderately to steeply west to south-west. The Kapanga deposit sits approximately 300 m to the east of the Central Lode deposit with strike length of 1.8 km, thickness averaging 150 meters and dips between 40 o and 60 o toward the west. Current drilling has defined the Kapanga deposit to approximately 450 meters depth below surface. The major minerals from the Greenbushes pegmatite are quartz, spodumene, albite and K-feldspar. The main lithium-bearing minerals are spodumene (containing approximately 8% lithium oxide) and varieties kunzite and hiddenite. Minor to trace lithium minerals include lepidolite mica, amblygonite and lithiophilite. Lithium is readily leached in the weathering environment and thus is virtually non-existent in weathered pegmatite. Exploration drilling at Greenbushes has been ongoing for over 40 years using reverse circulation and diamond drill holes. Three lithium mineral processing plants are currently operating on the Greenbushes site, two chemical grade plants and a technical grade plant. Tailings are discharged to the tailings storage facility without the need for any neutralization process. Additional infrastructure on site includes power and water supply facilities, a laboratory, administrative offices, occupational health/safety/training offices, dedicated mines rescue area, stores, storage sheds, workshops and engineering offices. The Greenbushes site also leases production drills, excavators, trucks and various support equipment to extract the ore deposit by open pit methods. Talison’s power is delivered by a local distribution system and reticulated and metered within the site. Water is sourced from rainfall and stored in several process dams located on site. We consider the condition of all of our plants, facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct, and we maintain them regularly. As of December 31, 2023, our 49% ownership interest of the gross asset value of the facilities at the Greenbushes site was approximately $803.5 million. Greenbushes is currently constructing a new chemical grade plant with a target completion in 2025 and is developing plans for a fourth chemical grade plant to be constructed in 2027. Other planned upgrades to the infrastructure include a new mine service area, a new mine access road, expansions of warehouse and laboratories and the expansion of tailings facilities. Talison ships the chemical-grade lithium concentrate in vessels to our facilities in Meishan and Xinyu, China, and by land transport to our Kemerton, Australia facility, to process into battery-grade lithium hydroxide. In addition, the output from Talison can be used by tolling entities in China to produce both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. 36 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries A summary of the Greenbushes facility’s lithium mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, and reserves as of December 31, 2023 is shown in the following tables. SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. (“SRK”), a third-party firm comprising mining experts in accordance with Item 1302(b)(1) of Regulation S-K, served as the QP and prepared the estimates of lithium mineral resources and reserves at the Greenbushes facility, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. A copy of the QP’s most recent technical report summary with respect to the lithium mineral resource and reserve estimates at the Greenbushes facility, dated February 9, 2024, with an effective date of June 30, 2023, is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this report. The amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on a 49% ownership percentage, and are presented as metric tonnes of lithium ore in thousands. The Greenbushes mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report through December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Indicated mineral resources 37,100 1.48% Inferred mineral resources 5,800 1.19% • Albemarle’s attributable portion of mineral resources is 49%. • Mineral resources are reported exclusive of mineral reserves. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. • Mineral resources have been reported as in situ (hard rock within an optimized pit shell and above the effective cutoff grade). • Mineral resources have been categorized subject to the opinion of the QP based on the quality of informing data for the estimate, consistency of geological/grade distribution, and data quality. • Mineral resources which are contained within the mineral reserves pit design may be excluded from mineral reserves due to an Inferred classification. • All indicated stockpiled resources have been converted to mineral reserves. • Open pit mineral resources are reported considering a nominal set of assumptions for reporting purposes: ◦ Chemical grade plant weight recovery (mass yield) varies as a function of Li2O% grade. The mass yield equation used for reasonable prospects for economic extraction pit optimization is Mass Yield %=9.362 x Li2O%^1.319 - 1.5, subject to a 97% recovery limitation when the Li2O grade exceeds 5.8%. Recovery is set to zero when the mass yield equation result for a block is less than zero. ◦ Derivation of economic cutoff grade for mineral resources is based on the mine gate pricing of $1,525/t of 6% Li 2 O concentrate. The mine gate price is based on $1,650/t-conc CIF less $125/t-conc for government royalty and transportation to China. ◦ Costs estimated in Australian Dollars (“AUD”) were converted to U.S. dollars based on an exchange rate of AUD1.00:$0.68. ◦ The economic cutoff grade calculation is based on $2.67/t-ore incremental ore mining cost, $31.90/t-ore processing cost, $9.24/t-ore G&A cost, and $2.35/t-ore sustaining capital cost. Incremental ore mining costs are the costs associated with the run-of-mine loader, stockpile rehandling, grade control assays and rockbreaker. ◦ The price, cost and mass yield parameters produce a calculated resource economic cutoff grade of 0.576% Li 2 O. However, due to the internal constraints of the current operations, an elevated mineral resource cutoff grade of 0.7% Li 2 O has been applied. SRK notes actual economic cutoff grade is lower, but it is the QP’s opinion to use a 0.7% Li 2 O cutoff grade to align with current site practices. ◦ An overall 40° (east side) and 47° (west side) pit slope angle, 0% mining dilution, and 100% mining recovery. ◦ Mineral resources were reported above the assigned 0.7% Li 2 O cutoff grade and are constrained by an optimized 0.90 revenue factor pit shell. ◦ No infrastructure movement capital costs have been added to the optimization. • Mineral resources tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding. The Greenbushes indicated mineral resources of 37.1 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 increased by 70% from 21.8 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The Greenbushes inferred mineral resources of 5.8 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 80% from 28.3 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The overall decrease in mineral resources was primarily driven by an update of the resource model as a result of the availability of new drilling data as well as  mine depletion during 2023. 37 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries The Greenbushes mineral reserve estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report through December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Probable mineral reserves: Reserve Pit 70,400 1.81% Stockpiles 1,400 2.51% • Albemarle’s attributable portion of mineral resources and mineral reserves is 49%. • Mineral reserves are reported exclusive of mineral resources. • Indicated in situ resources have been converted to Probable reserves. • Indicated stockpile resources have been converted to Probable mineral reserves. • Mineral reserves are reported considering a nominal set of assumptions for reporting purposes: ◦ Mineral reserves are based on a mine gate price of $1,383/metric tonne of chemical grade concentrate (6% Li 2 O). ◦ Mineral reserves assume 93% global mining recovery. ◦ Mineral reserves are diluted at approximately 5% at zero grade for all mineral reserve blocks in addition to internal dilution built into the resource model (2.8% with the assumed selective mining unit of 5 meter x 5 meter x 5 meter). ◦ The mass yield for reserves processed through the chemical grade plants is estimated based on mass yield formulas that vary depending on the Li2O% grade of the plant feed. For chemical grade plant 1, the formula is Mass Yield %=9.362 x Li2O%^1.319, subject to a 97% recovery limitation when the Li2O grade exceeds 5.5%. For chemical grade plant 2, chemical grade plant 3 and chemical grade plant 4, the formula is Mass Yield %=9.362 x Li2O%^1.319 - 1.5 subject to a 97% recovery limitation when the Li2O grade exceeds 5.8%. The weighted average life of mine mass yield for the four chemical grade plants is 19.5%. ◦ The formula for mass yield for reserves processed through the technical grade plant is Mass Yield %=26.629 x Li2O% - 60.455. There is approximately 3.2 million metric tonnes of technical grade plant feed at 3.7% Li2O. The average life of mine mass yield for the technical grade plant is 38.0%. ◦ Although Greenbushes produces a technical grade product from the current operation, it is assumed that the reserves reported herein will be sold as a chemical grade product. This assumption is necessary because feed for the technical grade plant is currently only defined at the grade control or blasting level. Therefore, it is conservatively assumed that concentrate produced by the technical grade plant will be sold at the chemical grade product price. ◦ Derivation of economic cutoff grade for reserves is based on mine gate pricing of $1,383/t of 6% Li 2 O concentrate. The mine gate price is based on $1,500/t-conc CIF less $117/t-conc for government royalty and transportation. ◦ Costs estimated in AUD were converted to U.S. dollars based on an exchange rate of AUD1.00:$0.68. ◦ The economic cutoff grade calculation is based on US$2.67/t-ore incremental ore mining cost, $31.90/t-ore processing cost, $9.24/t-ore G&A cost, and $2.35/t-ore sustaining capital cost. Incremental ore mining costs are the costs associated with the run-of-mine loader, stockpile rehandling, grade control assays and rockbreaker ◦ The price, cost and mass yield parameters produce a calculated economic cutoff grade of 0.606% Li 2 O. However, due to the internal constraints of the current operations, an elevated Mineral Reserves cutoff grade of 0.7% Li 2 O has been applied. ◦ The cutoff grade of 0.7% Li 2 O was applied to reserves that are constrained by the ultimate pit design and are detailed in a yearly mine schedule. ◦ Stockpile reserves have been previously mined and are reported at a 0.7% Li 2 O cutoff grade. • Waste tonnage within the reserve pit is 716.6 million metric tonnes at a strip ratio of 4.93:1 (waste to ore – not including mineral reserve stockpiles). • Mineral reserve tonnage, grade and mass yield have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding. Mineral reserves metric tonnes are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand tonnes. The Greenbushes total mineral reserves of 71.8 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 7% from 77.0 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The decrease in total mineral reserves was primarily driven by a different mineral resources block model, a higher strip ratio, an increase in estimated operating costs and 2023 mine depletion from 2023 production. The life of mine sustaining capital cost of $2.35/metric tonne of ore was used only for the purposes of pit optimization and cut-off grade calculation. This sustaining capital cost was based on estimates of life of mine annual sustaining capital costs for Greenbushes that were included in the 2024 budget. Subsequent to pit optimization, design and scheduling, a detailed estimate of life of mine sustaining capital costs was prepared. Additional information about key assumptions and parameters relating to the lithium mineral resources and reserves at the Greenbushes facility is discussed in sections 11 and 12, respectively, of the Greenbushes technical report summary. 38 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Wodgina, Australia The Wodgina property, which includes a hard rock, open pit mine (latitude -21° 11' 25\"S, longitude 118° 40' 25\"E ) is located approximately 110 km south-southeast of Port Hedland, Western Australia between the Turner and Yule Rivers. The area includes multiple prominent greenstone ridges up to 180 m above mean sea level surrounded by granitic plains and lowlands. The property is accessible via National Highway 1 to National highway 95 to the Wodgina camp road. All roads to site are paved. The nearest large regional airport is in Port Hedland which also hosts an international deep-water port facility. In addition, a site dedicated all-weather airstrip is located near to site, capable of landing certain aircrafts. The Wodgina pegmatite deposits were discovered in 1902. Since then, the pegmatite-hosted deposits have been mined for tin, tantalum, beryl, and lithium by various companies. Mining occurred sporadically until Goldrim Mining formed a new partnership with Pan West Tantalum Pty Ltd., who opened open pit mining at the site in 1989 and progressively expanded during the 1990s. Active mining at the Mt. Cassiterite pit has been started and stopped regularly between 2008 and the present. The mine was placed on care and maintenance in 2008, 2012, and most recently in 2019.  In 2016, MRL acquired the mine and upgraded the processing facilities and site infrastructure to 750ktpa spodumene plant producing 6% spodumene concentrate, completed in 2019. On October 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 60% interest in this hard rock lithium mine project and formed an unincorporated joint venture with MRL, named MARBL. We formed MARBL for the exploration, development, mining, processing and production of lithium and other minerals (other than iron ore and tantalum) from Wodgina. Production of spodumene concentrate from the first and second trains at the Wodgina mine was achieved in May and July of 2022, respectively, after it had been idled following its acquisition in 2019. On October 18, 2023, we closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with MRL, which resulted in the reduction of our ownership interest in Wodgina to 50% from 60%. Wodgina holds mining tenements within the Karriyarra native title claim and are subject to the Land Use Agreement dated March 2001 between the Karriyarra People and Gwalia Tantalum Ltd (now Wodgina Lithium, a 100% subsidiary of MRL, our MARBL joint venture partner). See section 3 of the Wodgina technical report summary, filed as Exhibit 96.2 to this report, for a listing of all mining and exploration land tenements, which are in good standing and without any known impediments. Certain 39 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries tenements are due for renewal in 2026 and another in 2030. Drilling and exploration activities have been conducted throughout the mining life of the Wodgina property. The Wodgina mine is a pegmatite lithium deposit with spodumene the dominant mineral. The lithium mineralization occurs as 10 - 30 cm long grey-white spodumene crystals within medium grained pegmatites comprising primarily of quartz, feldspar, spodumene, and muscovite. Typically, the spodumene crystals are oriented orthogonal to the pegmatite contacts. The facilities at Wodgina consist of a three stage crushing plant, the spodumene concentration plant, administrative offices, an accommodation camp, a power station, gas pipeline, three mature and reliable water bore fields, extension for future tailing storage and a fleet of owned and leased mine production equipment. The gas pipeline feeds the site power station to provide the power to the facilities. Water is obtained from the dedicated water bore fields. We consider the condition of all of our plants, facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct, and we maintain them regularly. As of December 31, 2023, our 50% ownership interest of the gross asset value of the facilities at our Wodgina site was approximately $271.0 million. A summary of the Wodgina facility’s lithium mineral resources as of December 31, 2023 is shown in the following table. SRK served as the QP and prepared the estimates of lithium mineral resources at the Wodgina facility, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. No reserves have been declared at Wodgina. A copy of the QP’s most recent technical report summary with respect to the lithium mineral resource estimates at the Wodgina facility, dated February 14, 2023, with an effective date of December 31, 2022, is filed as Exhibit 96.2 to this report. The mineral resource economic assumptions remain unchanged from December 31, 2022. The December 31, 2022 resource has been depleted for actual production and adjusted for the new 50% ownership percentage noted above, and is reported as of December 31, 2023 in the below table. Mineral resources represent 50% interest in Wodgina, which is attributable to the Company’s interest in the MARBL joint venture. Amounts are presented as metric tonnes of lithium ore in thousands. The Wodgina mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report through December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Grade (Li 2 O%) Indicated mineral resources 8,800 1.31% Inferred mineral resources 81,700 1.12% • The summary mineral resources attributable tonnes reflects Albemarle’s 50% ownership percentage in Wodgina. • All significant figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. • The mineral resource estimate has been classified in accordance with SEC S-K 1300 guidelines and definitions. • The Cassiterite Deposit comprises the historically mined Mt. Cassiterite pit and undeveloped North Hill areas. • Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their economic and technical feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resources can be upgraded to measured or indicated mineral resources. • Metallurgical recovery of lithium has been estimated on a block basis at a consistent 65% based on documentation from historical plant production. • To demonstrate reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction of Mineral Resources, a cut-off grade of 0.5% Li2O based on metal recoverability assumptions, long-term price assumptions of $584 per metric tonne, variable mining costs averaging $3.40/metric tonne, processing costs and G&A costs totaling $23/metric tonne. • Mass yield is defined as (Li 2 O%*metallurgical recovery) / concentrate grade where Li 2 O% = lithium oxide grade in percent, metallurgical recovery = 65% and concentrate grade = 6%. • The mineral resources are constrained by an economic pit shell using an overall 43° pit slope angle, 0% mining dilution, and 100% mining recovery. • There are no known legal, political, environmental, or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the Mineral Resources based on the level of study completed for this property. The Wodgina indicated mineral resources of 8.8 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 30% from 12.6 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The Wodgina inferred mineral resources of 81.7 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 17% from 98.3 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The decrease in mineral resources was driven by the change in ownership interest in Wodgina from 60% to 50% as a result of the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture agreement, and depletion during the year. There were no changes to the model. The Wodgina mine is at an initial assessment level, and as a result, contains no mineral reserves. Additional information about key assumptions and parameters relating to the lithium mineral resources at the Wodgina facility is discussed in section 11 of the Wodgina technical report summary. 40 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Salar de Atacama/La Negra, Chile The Salar de Atacama is located in the commune of San Pedro de Atacama, with the operations approximately 100 kilometers to the south of this commune, in the extreme east of the Antofagasta Region and close to the border with the republics of Argentina and Bolivia. Access to the property is on the major four-lane paved Panamericana Route 5 north from Antofagasta, Chile approximately 60 km northeast to B-385. On B-385, a two-lane paved highway, the Albemarle Salar de Atacama project (latitude 23°38'31.52\"S, longitude 68°19'30.31\"W) is approximately 175 km to the east. The site has a small private airport that serves the project. A small paved runway airport is also located near San Pedro de Atacama and a large international airport is located in Antofagasta. The La Negra plant (latitude 23°45'20.31\"S, longitude 70°18'36.92\"W) has direct access roads and located approximately 20 km by paved four lane highway Route 28 southeast of Antofagasta turning north approximately 3 km on Route 5. In the early 1960s, water with high concentrations of salts was discovered in the Salar de Atacama Basin. In January 1975, one of our predecessors, Foote Mineral Company, signed a long-term contract with the Chilean government for mineral rights with respect to the Salar de Atacama consisting exclusively of the right to access lithium brine, covering an area of approximately 16,700 hectares. See section 3 of the Salar de Atacama technical report summary, filed as Exhibit 96.3 to this report, for a listing of mining concessions at the Salar de Atacama site. The contract originally permitted the production and sale of up to 200,000 metric tons of lithium metal equivalent (“LME”), a calculated percentage of LCE. In 1981, the first construction of evaporation ponds in the Salar de Atacama began. The following year, the construction of the lithium carbonate plant in La Negra began. In 1990, the facilities at the Salar de Atacama were expanded with a new well system and the capacity of the lithium carbonate plant in the La Negra plant was expanded. In 1998, the lithium chloride plant in La Negra began operating, the same year that Chemetall purchased Foote Mineral Company. Subsequently, in 2004, Chemetall was acquired by Rockwood, and in 2015, Rockwood was acquired by Albemarle. Effective January 1, 2017, the Chilean government and Albemarle entered into an annex to the original agreement through which its duration was modified, extending it until the 41 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries balance of: (a) the original 200,000 metric tons of LME and an additional 262,132 metric tons of LME granted through this annex have been exploited, processed, and sold, or (b) on January 1, 2044, whichever comes first. In addition, the amended agreement provides for commission payments to the Chilean government based on sales price/metric ton on the amounts sold under the additional quota granted, our support of research and development in Chile of lithium applications and solar energy, and our support of local communities in Northern Chile. Albemarle currently operates its extraction and production facilities in Chile under this mineral rights agreement with the Chilean government. The Salar de Atacama is a salt flat, the largest in Chile, located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, which is the driest place on the planet and thus has an extremely high annual rate of evaporation and extremely low annual rainfall. Our extraction through evaporation process works as follows: snow in the Andes Mountains melts and flows into underground pools of water containing brine, which generally have high concentrations of lithium. We then pump the water containing brine above ground through a series of pumps and wells into a network of large evaporation ponds. Over the course of approximately eighteen months, the desert sun evaporates the water causing other salts to precipitate and leaving behind concentrated lithium brine. If weather conditions are not favorable, the evaporation process may be prolonged. After we obtain the lithium brine from the Salar de Atacama, we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at our manufacturing facilities in nearby La Negra, Chile. The filling materials of the Salar de Atacama Basin are dominated by the Vilama Formation and the more recently, in geologic time, by evaporitic and clastic materials that are currently being deposited in the basin. These units house the basin's aquifer system and are composed of evaporitic chemical sediments that include carbonate, gypsum and halite intervals interrupted by volcanic deposits of large sheets of ignimbrite, volcanic ash and smaller classical deposits. Lithium-rich brines are extracted from the halite aquifer that is located within the nucleus of the salt flat. The Salar de Atacama basin contains a continental system of lithium-rich brine. These types of systems have six common (global) characteristics: arid climate; closed basin that contains a salt flat (salt crust), a salt lake, or both; igneous and/or hydrothermal activity; tectonic subsidence; suitable sources of lithium; and sufficient time to concentrate the lithium in the brine. In the Salar de Atacama basin, lithium-rich brines are found in a halite aquifer. Carbonate and sulfates are found near the edges of the basin. The average, minimum and maximum concentrations of lithium in the Salar de Atacama basin are approximately 1,400, 900 and 7,000 mg/L, respectively. From 2017 through 2019, two drilling campaigns were carried out in order to obtain geological and hydrogeological information at the Albemarle mining concession. The facilities at the Salar de Atacama consist of extraction wells, evaporation and concentration ponds, leaching plants, a potash plant, a drying plant, a salar yield improvement plant, services and general areas, including salt stockpiles, as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment. In addition, the site includes administrative offices, an operations building and a laboratory. The extracted concentrated lithium brine is sent to the La Negra plant by truck for processing. The Salar de Atacama has its own powerhouse that generates the energy necessary for the entire operation of the facilities. We also have permanent and continuous groundwater exploitation rights for two wells that are for industrial use and to supply the Salar de Atacama facilities. The La Negra facilities consist of a boron removal plant, a calcium and magnesium removal plant, two lithium carbonate conversion plants, a lithium chloride plant, evaporation-sedimentation ponds, an offsite area where the raw materials are housed and the inputs that are used in the process are prepared, a dry area where the various products are prepared, as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment. La Negra is supplied electricity from a local company and has rights to a well in the Peine community for its water supply. We completed construction of the third lithium carbonate conversion plant in late 2022. We consider the condition of all of our plants, facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct, and we maintain them regularly. As of December 31, 2023, the combined gross asset value of our facilities at the Salar de Atacama and in La Negra, Chile (not inclusive of construction in process) was approximately $1.9 billion. A summary of the Salar de Atacama facility’s lithium mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, and reserves as of December 31, 2023 are shown in the following tables. SRK served as the QP and prepared the estimates of lithium mineral resources (exclusive of reserves) and reserves at the Salar de Atacama facility, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. A copy of the QP’s most recent technical report summary with respect to the lithium mineral resource and reserve estimates at the Salar de Atacama facility, dated February 14, 2023, with an effective date of August 31, 2022, is filed as Exhibit 96.3 to this report. The mineral resource economic assumptions remain unchanged from August 31, 2022. The August 31, 2022 resource has been depleted for actual production and is reported as of December 31, 2023 in the below table. The amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on a 100% ownership percentage, and are presented as metric tonnes of lithium metal in thousands. 42 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries The Salar de Atacama mineral resource, exclusive of reserves, estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report to December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Li Concentration (mg/L) Measured mineral resources 471 2,390 Indicated mineral resources 363 1,943 Measured and Indicated mineral resources 834 2,195 Inferred mineral resources 237 1,617 • Mineral resources are reported exclusive of mineral reserves. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. • Given the dynamic reserve versus the static resource, a direct measurement of resources post-reserve extraction is not practical. Therefore, as a simplification, to calculate mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, the quantity of lithium pumped in the life of mine plan was subtracted from the overall resource without modification to lithium concentration. Measured and indicated resource were deducted proportionate to their contribution to the overall mineral resource. • Resources are reported on an in situ basis. • Resources are reported above the elevation of 2,200 meters above sea level. Resources are reported as lithium metal. • Resources have been categorized subject to the opinion of a QP based on the amount/robustness of informing data for the estimate, consistency of geological/grade distribution, survey information. • Resources have been calculated using drainable porosity estimated from measured values in Upper Halite and Volcano-sedimentary units, and bibliographical values based on the lithology and QP’s experience in similar deposits. • The estimated economic cutoff grade utilized for resource reporting purposes is 800 mg/l lithium, based on the following assumptions: ◦ A technical grade lithium carbonate price of $22,000/metric tonne CIF La Negra. This is a 10% premium to the price utilized for reserve reporting purposes. The 10% premium applied to the resource versus the reserve was selected to generate a resource larger than the reserve, ensuring the resource fully encompassed the reserve while still maintaining reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction. ◦ Recovery factors for the salar operation increase gradually over the span of 4 years, from 40% in 2022 to the proposed salar yield improvement program 65% recovery in 2025. After that point, evaporation pond recovery is relatively constant at 65%. An additional recovery factor of 80% lithium recovery is applied to the La Negra lithium carbonate plant. ◦ An average annual brine pumping rate of 414 L/s is assumed to meet drawdown constraint consistent with Albemarle’s permit conditions. ◦ Operating cost estimates are based on a combination of fixed brine extraction, G&A and plant costs and variable costs associated with raw brine pumping rate or lithium production rate. Average life of mine operating cost is calculated at approximately $4,155/metric tonne CIF Asia. ◦ Sustaining capital costs are included in the cut-off grade calculation and post the salar yield improvement program installation, average around $98 million per year. • Mineral Resources tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding. The Salar de Atacama measured and indicated mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, as of December 31, 2023 did not change from the reported balances as of December 31, 2022 as all 2023 production was depleted from the reserves. The Salar de Atacama reserve estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report through December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Proven mineral reserves: In Situ 297 2,316 In Process 24 2,841 Probable mineral reserves: In Situ 210 2,050 Total mineral reserves: In Situ 507 2,198 In Process 24 2,841 • In process reserves quantify the prior 24 months of pumping data and reflect the raw brine, at the time of pumping. These reserves represent the first 24 months of feed to the lithium process plant in the 2022 economic model. 43 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries • Proven reserves have been estimated as the lithium mass pumped during Years 2024 through 2033 of the proposed life of mine plan. • Probable reserves have been estimated as the lithium mass pumped from 2034 until the end of the proposed life of mine plan (2041). • The ratio of in situ proven to probable reserves has remained consistent through depletion since the development of the reserve model in 2022 with approximately 57% of the reserve designated as probable and 43% of the reserve designated as proven. • Reserves are reported as lithium metal • This mineral reserve estimate was derived based on a production pumping plan truncated in December 31, 2041 (i.e., approximately 19 years). This plan was truncated to reflect the projected depletion of Albemarle’s authorized lithium production quota. • The 2022 reserve model used as the basis for depletion has not been updated. The following assumptions were used in developing that model: ◦ The estimated economic cut-off grade for the Project is 858 mg/l lithium, based on the assumptions discussed below. The truncated production pumping plan remained well above the economic cut-off grade (i.e., the economic cut-off grade did not result in a limiting factor to the estimation of the reserve). ◦ A technical grade lithium carbonate price of $20,000/metric tonne CIF Asia. ◦ Recovery factors for the salar operation increase gradually over the span of 4 years, from 40% in 2022 to the proposed salar yield improvement program 65% recovery in 2025. After that point, evaporation pond recovery remains relatively constant at 65%, An additional recovery factor of 80% lithium recovery is applied to the La Negra lithium carbonate plant. ◦ A fixed average annual brine pumping rate of 414 L/s is assumed to meet consistent with Albemarle’s permit conditions. ◦ Operating cost estimates are based on a combination of fixed brine extraction, G&A and plant costs and variable costs associated with raw brine pumping rate or lithium production rate. Average life of mine operating cost is calculated at approximately $4,155/metric tonne CIF Asia. ◦ Sustaining capital costs are included in the cut-off grade calculation and post the salar yield improvement program installation, average around $98 million per year. • Mineral reserve tonnage, grade and mass yield have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate and numbers may not add due to rounding. The Salar de Atacama total mineral reserves of 531,000 metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 6% from 566,000 metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The decrease in total mineral reserves was driven by depletion during the year as there were no changes to the model. Additional information about key assumptions and parameters relating to the lithium mineral resources and reserves at the Salar de Atacama facility is discussed in sections 11 and 12, respectively, of the Salar de Atacama technical report summary. 44 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Silver Peak, Nevada The Silver Peak site (latitude 37.751773°N, longitude 117.639027°W) is located in a rural area approximately 30 miles southwest of Tonopah, in Esmeralda County, Nevada. It is located in the Clayton Valley, an arid valley historically covered with dry lake beds (playas). The operation borders the small, unincorporated town of Silver Peak, Nevada. Albemarle uses the Silver Peak site for the production of lithium brines, which are used to make lithium carbonate and, to a lesser degree, lithium hydroxide. Access to the site is off of the paved highway SR-265 in the town of Silver Peak, Nevada. The administrative offices are located on the south side of the road. The process facility is on the north side of the road and the brine operations are located approximately three miles east of Silver Peak on Silver Peak Road and occupy both the north and south sides of the road. In addition, access to the site is also possible via gravel/dirt roads from Tonopah, Nevada and Goldfield, Nevada. Lithium brine extraction in the Clayton Valley began in the mid-1960’s by one of our predecessors, the Foote Mineral Company. Since that time, lithium brine operations have been operated on a continuous basis. In 1998, Chemetall purchased Foote Mineral Company. Subsequently, in 2004, Chemetall was acquired by Rockwood, and in 2015, Rockwood was acquired by Albemarle. Our mineral rights in Silver Peak consist of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to our permitted and certified senior water rights, a settlement agreement with the U.S. government, originally entered into in June 1991, and our patented and unpatented land claims. Pursuant to the 1991 agreement, our water rights and our land claims, we have rights to all lithium that we can remove economically from the Clayton Valley Basin in Nevada. See section 3 of the Silver Peak technical report summary, filed as Exhibit 96.4 to this report, for a listing of patented and unpatented claims at the Silver Peak site. We have been operating at the Silver Peak site since 1966. Our Silver Peak site covers a surface of over 13,500 acres, more than 10,500 acres of which we own through a subsidiary. The remaining acres are owned by the U.S. government from whom we lease the land pursuant to unpatented land claims that are renewed annually. Actual surface disturbance associated with the operations is 7,390 acres, primarily associated with the evaporation ponds. The manufacturing and administrative activities are confined to an area approximately 20 acres in size. 45 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries We extract lithium brine from our Silver Peak site through substantially the same evaporation process we use at the Salar de Atacama. We process the lithium brine extracted from our Silver Peak site into lithium carbonate at our plant in Silver Peak. It is hypothesized that the current levels of lithium dissolved in brine originate from relatively recent dissolution of halite by meteoric waters that have penetrated the playa in the last 10,000 years. The halite formed in the playa during the aforementioned climatic periods of low precipitation and that the concentrated lithium was incorporated as liquid inclusions into the halite crystals. There are no current exploration activities on the Silver Peak lithium operation. However, in January 2021, we announced that we will expand capacity in Silver Peak and begin a program to evaluate clays and other available Nevada resources for commercial production of lithium. As previously announced, we are investing in our Silver Peak site with the goal of doubling the current production in Silver Peak by 2025 by making full use of the brine water rights. The facilities at Silver Peak consist of extraction wells, evaporation and concentration ponds, a lithium carbonate plant, a lithium anhydrous plant, a lithium hydroxide plant, a new liming plant, wellfield and mill maintenance, a shipping and packaging facility and administrative offices, as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment. Silver Peak is supplied electricity from a local company and we currently have two operating fresh water wells nearby that supply water to the facilities. We consider the condition of all of our plants, facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct, and we maintain them regularly. As of December 31, 2023, the gross asset value of our facilities at our Silver Peak site was approximately $139.1 million. A summary of the Silver Peak facility’s lithium mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, and reserves as of December 31, 2023 is shown in the following tables. SRK served as the QP and prepared the estimates of lithium mineral resources (exclusive of reserves) and reserves at the Silver Peak facility, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. A copy of the QP’s most recent technical report summary with respect to the lithium mineral resource and reserve estimates at the Silver Peak facility, dated February 14, 2023, with an effective date of September 30, 2022, is filed as Exhibit 96.4 to this report. The mineral resource economic assumptions remain unchanged from September 30, 2022. The September 30, 2022 resource has been depleted for actual production and is reported as of December 31, 2023 in the below table. The amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on a 100% ownership percentage, and are presented as metric tonnes of lithium metal in thousands. The Silver Peak mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report through December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Measured mineral resources 14 153 Indicated mineral resources 36 144 Measured and Indicated mineral resources 50 146 Inferred mineral resources 90 121 • Mineral resources are reported exclusive of mineral reserves. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. • Given the dynamic reserve versus the static resource, a direct measurement of resources post-reserve extraction is not practical. Therefore, as a simplification, to calculate mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, the quantity of lithium pumped in the life of mine plan was subtracted from the overall resource without modification to lithium concentration. Measured and indicated resource were deducted proportionate to their contribution to the overall mineral resource. • Resources are reported on an in situ basis. • Resources are reported as lithium metal. • The resources have been calculated from the block model above 740 meters above sea level. • Resources have been categorized subject to the opinion of a QP based on the amount/robustness of informing data for the estimate, consistency of geological/grade distribution, survey information. • Resources have been calculated using drainable porosity estimated from bibliographical values based on the lithology and QP’s experience in similar deposits. • The estimated economic cutoff grade utilized for resource reporting purposes is 50 mg/l lithium, based on the following assumptions: ◦ A technical grade lithium carbonate price of $22,000/metric tonne CIF North Carolina. This is a 10% premium to the price utilized for reserve reporting purposes. The 10% premium applied to the resource versus the reserve was selected to generate a resource larger than the reserve, ensuring the resource fully encompassed the reserve while still maintaining reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction. ◦ Recovery factors for the wellfield are = -206.23*(Li wellfield feed)2 +7.1903*(wellfield Li feed)+0.4609. An additional recovery factor of 78% lithium recovery is applied to the lithium carbonate plant. ◦ A fixed brine pumping rate of 20,000 acre feet per year, ramped up from 2022 levels over a period of five years. 46 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries ◦ Operating cost estimates are based on a combination of fixed brine extraction, G&A and plant costs and variable costs associated with raw brine pumping rate or lithium production rate. Average life of mine operating costs is calculated at approximately $6,200/metric tonne lithium carbonate CIF North Carolina. ◦ Sustaining capital costs are included in the cut-off grade calculation and include a fixed component at $7.0 million per year and an additional component tied to the estimated number of wells replaced per year and other planned capital programs. • Mineral Resources tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding. The Silver Peak measured and indicated mineral resources, exclusive of reserves, as of December 31, 2023 did not change from the reported balances as of December 31, 2022 as all 2023 production was depleted from the reserves. The Silver Peak reserve estimates with depletion from production from the effective date of the report through December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table: Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Concentration (mg/L) Proven mineral reserves: In Situ 12 93 In Process 1 101 Probable mineral reserves: In Situ 54 95 Total mineral reserves: In Situ 66 95 In Process 1 101 • In process reserves quantify the prior 24 months of pumping data and reflect the raw brine, at the time of pumping. These reserves represent the first 24 months of feed to the lithium process plant in the 2022 economic model. • Proven reserves have been estimated as the lithium mass pumped during the years 2024 through 2028 of the proposed life of mine plan. • Probable reserves have been estimated as the lithium mass pumped from 2029 until the end of the proposed life of mine plan (2052). • The ratio of in situ proven to probable reserves has remained consistent through depletion since the development of the reserve model in 2022 with approximately 82% of the reserve designated as Probable and 18% of the reserve designated as Proven. • Reserves are reported as lithium metal. • This mineral reserve estimate was derived based on a production pumping plan truncated at the end of year 2052 (i.e., approximately 29.5 years). This plan was truncated to reflect the QP’s opinion on uncertainty associated with the production plan as a direct conversion of measured and indicated resource to proven and probable reserve is not possible in the same way as a typical hard-rock mining project. • The 2022 reserve model used as the basis for depletion has not been updated. The following assumptions were used in developing that model: ◦ The estimated economic cut-off grade for the Silver Peak project is 57 mg/l lithium, based on the assumptions discussed below. The production pumping plan was truncated due to technical uncertainty inherent in long-term production modeling and remained well above the economic cut-off grade (i.e., the economic cut-off grade did not result in a limiting factor to the estimation of the reserve). ◦ A technical grade lithium carbonate price of $20,000/metric tonne CIF North Carolina. ◦ Recovery factors for the wellfield are = -206.23*(Li wellfield feed)^2 +7.1903*(wellfield Li feed) + 0.4609. An additional recovery factor of 78% lithium recovery is applied to the lithium carbonate plant. ◦ A fixed brine pumping rate of 20,000 acre feet per year, ramped up from 2022 levels over a period of five years. ◦ Operating cost estimates are based on a combination of fixed brine extraction, G&A and plant costs and variable costs associated with raw brine pumping rate or lithium production rate. Average life of mine operating costs is calculated at approximately $6,200/metric tonne LC CIF North Carolina. ◦ Sustaining capital costs are included in the cut-off grade calculation and include a fixed component at $7.0 million per year and an additional component tied to the estimated number of wells replaced per year and other planned capital programs. • Mineral reserve tonnage, grade and mass yield have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate (thousand tonnes), and numbers may not add due to rounding. The Silver Peak total mineral reserves of 67,500 metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 2% from 69,100 metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The decrease in total mineral reserves was driven by depletion during the year as there were no changes to the model. Additional information about key assumptions and parameters relating to the lithium mineral resources and reserves at the Silver Peak facility is discussed in sections 11 and 12, respectively, of the Silver Peak technical report summary. 47 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Safi, Jordan Our 50% interest in JBC, a consolidated joint venture established in 1999, with operations in Safi, Jordan, acquires bromine that is originally sourced from the Dead Sea. JBC processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products. The JBC operation (latitude 31°8'34.85\"N , longitude 35°31'34.68\"E ) is located in Safi, Jordan, and is located on a 26-hectare area on the southeastern edge of the Dead Sea, about 6 kilometers north of the of the APC plant. JBC also has a 2-hectare storage facility within the free-zone industrial area at the Port of Aqaba. The Jordan Valley Highway/Route 65 is the primary method of access for supplies and personnel to JBC. The Port of Aqaba is the main entry point for supplies and equipment for JBC, where imported shipping containers are offloaded from ships and are transported by truck to JBC via the Jordan Valley Highway. Aqaba is approximately 205 km south of JBC via Highway 65. Major international airports can be readily accessed either at Amman or Aqaba. Jordan’s railway transport runs north-south through Jordan and is not used to transport JBC employees and product. In 1958, the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan granted APC a concession for exclusive rights to exploit the minerals and salts from the Dead Sea brine until 2058; at that time, APC factories and installations would become the property of the Government. APC was granted its exclusive mineral rights under the Concession Ratification Law No. 16 of 1958. APC produces potash from the brine extracted from the Dead Sea. A concentrated bromide-enriched brine extracted from APC’s evaporation ponds is the feed material for the JBC plant. Following the formation of the joint venture, the JBC bromine plant began operations in 2002. Expansion of the facilities to double its bromine production capacity went into operation in 2017. The climate, geology and location provide a setting that makes the Dead Sea a valuable large-scale natural resource for potash and bromine. Today, the Dead Sea has a surface area of 583 km 2 and a brine volume of 110 km 3 . The Dead Sea is the world’s saltiest natural lake, containing high concentrations of ions compared to that of regular seawater and an unusually high amount of magnesium and bromine. There is an estimated 900 million tonnes of bromine in the Dead Sea. 48 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Mining methods consist of all activities necessary to extract brine from the Dead Sea and extract Bromine. The low rainfall, low humidity and high temperatures in the Dead Sea area provide ideal conditions for recovering potash from the brine by solar evaporation. JBC obtains its feedbrine from APC’s evaporation pond and this supply is intimately linked to the APC operation. As evaporation takes place the specific gravity of the brine increases until its constituent salts progressively crystallize and precipitate out of solution, starting with sodium chloride (common salt) precipitating out to the bottom of the ponds (pre-carnallite ponds). Brine is transferred to other pans in succession where its specific gravity increases further, ultimately precipitating out of the sodium chloride. Carnallite precipitation takes place at the evaporation pond where it is harvested from the brine and pumped as slurry to a process plant (where the potassium chloride is separated from the magnesium chloride). JBC extracts the bromide-rich, “carnallite-free” brine through a pumping station. This brine feeds the bromine and magnesium plants. There is no exploration as typically conducted for the characterization of a mineral deposit. Infrastructure and facilities to support the operation of the bromine production plant at the Safi site is compact and contained in an approximately 33 hectare area. JBC ships product in bulk through a storage terminal in Aqaba. There are above ground storage tanks as well as pumps and piping for loading these products onto ships. JBC main activities at Aqaba are raw material/product storing, importing, and exporting. An evaporation pond collects the waste streams from pipe flushing, housekeeping, and other activities. Fresh water is sources from the Mujib Reservoir, a man-made reservoir. JBC is supplied electricity from the National Electric Power Company of Jordan. We consider the condition of all of our plants, facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct, and we maintain them regularly. As of December 31, 2023, our 50% ownership interest of the gross asset value of the facilities at the Safi, Jordan site was approximately $243.7 million. A summary of the Safi facility’s bromine mineral resources and reserves as of December 31, 2023 is provided below. RPS Energy Canada Ltd (“RPS”), a third-party firm comprising mining experts in accordance with Item 1302(b)(1) of Regulation S-K, served as the QP and prepared the estimates of bromine mineral resources and reserves at the Safi facility, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. A copy of the QP’s amended technical report summary with respect to the bromine mineral resource and reserve estimates at the Safi facility, dated February 14, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 96.5 to this report. The feedstock is drawn from the Dead Sea, a nonconventional reservoir owned by the nations of Israel and Jordan. As such, there are no specific resources owned by JBC, but Albemarle’s joint venture partner, APC, has exclusive rights granted by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to withdraw brine from the Dead Sea and process it to extract minerals. Revenues are based on a forecast bromine price ranging from $1,938 to $3,525 per metric tonne and the operating cost ranges between $648 and $972 per metric tonne . The measured resource of bromide ion attributable to Albemarle’s 50% interest in its JBC joint venture is estimated to be approximately 175.69 million metric tonnes. JBC is extracting approximately 1 percent of the bromine available in Jordan’s share of the Dead Sea. Bromide concentration in the Dead Sea is estimated to average approximately 5,000 ppm. The cut-off grade of the Albemarle bromine operations has been estimated to be at 1,000 ppm. The bromide ion concentration in the brine extracted which feeds the bromine plants, significantly exceeds the selected cut-off grade. The Safi measured mineral reserves of 175.69 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 1% from 178.3 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The decrease in measured mineral resources was driven by depletion and evaporation in the Dead Sea during 2023. The end date of the forecast remained unchanged due to the concession agreement. All bromine reserves reported by Albemarle for the JBC project are classified as proven mineral reserves. The mineral reserve estimate attributable to Albemarle’s 50% interest in its JBC joint venture is approximately 2.07 million metric tonnes of bromine from the Dead Sea. This estimate is based on the time available under the concession agreement with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the processing capability of the JBC plant. As only approximately one percent of the available resource is consumed from the Dead Sea, as noted above, the reserve estimate is based on the amount the JBC plant can produce over until the end of 2058, when the APC concession agreement ends. Revenues are based on a forecast bromine price ranging from $1,938 to $3,525 per metric tonne and the operating cost ranges between $648 and $972 per metric tonne . At the plant process recovery of 90 to 95 percent (bromine from bromide), product bromine is estimated at approximately 118,000 metric tonnes per year. Bromine concentration used to calculate the reserve estimate from the Dead Sea was approximately 7,645 ppm based on historical pumping. The cut-off grade of the Albemarle bromine operations has been estimated to be at 1,000 ppm. The bromide ion concentration in the brine extracted which feeds the bromine plants, significantly exceeds the selected cut-off grade. The Safi total mineral reserves of 2.07 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 decreased by 13% from 2.38 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The decrease in total mineral reserves was driven by depletion and evaporation in the Dead Sea during 2023. The end date of the forecast remained unchanged due to the concession agreement. Additional information about key assumptions and parameters relating to the bromine mineral resources and reserves at the Safi facility is discussed in sections 11 and 12, respectively, of the Safi technical report summary. 49 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Magnolia, Arkansas Magnolia is located in the southwest Arkansas, north of the center of Columbia County, approximately 50 miles east of Texarkana and 135 miles south of Little Rock. Our facilities include two separate production plants, the South Plant and the West Plant. The South Plant (latitude 33.1775°N, longitude 93.2161°W) is accessible via U.S. Route 79 and paved local roads. The West Plant (latitude 33.2648°N, longitude 93.3151°W) is accessible by U.S. Route 371 and paved local roads. The decentralized well sites around the brine fields are accessed via paved Arkansas Highway 19, 98, 160 and 344. In Magnolia, bromine is recovered from underground brine wells and then processed into a variety of end products at the plant on location. Albemarle has more than 50 brine production and injection wells that are currently active on the property. Albemarle’s area of bromine operation is comprised of over 9,500 individual leases with local landowners comprising a total area of over 99,500 acres. The leases have been acquired over time as field development extended across the field. Each lease continues for a period of 25 years or longer until after a two year period where brine is not injected or produced from/to a well within two miles of lease land areas, as long as lease rentals are continuing to be paid. See section 3 of the Magnolia technical report summary, filed as Exhibit 96.6 to this report, for a map of leases and burdens on those leases at the Magnolia site. Bromine extraction began in Magnolia in 1965 as the first brine supply well was drilled, and additional wells were put into production over the next few years. In 1987, a predecessor company took over operations of certain brine supply and injection wells, which Albemarle continues to operate to this day. In 2019, Albemarle completed, and put into production, two new brine production supply wells in Magnolia. In Magnolia, bromine exists as sodium bromide in the formation waters or brine of the Jurassic age Smackover Formation, a geological formation in Arkansas, in the subsurface at 7,000 to 8,500 feet below sea level. The mineralization occurs within the highly saline Smackover Formation waters or brine where the bromide has an abnormally rich composition. The bromine concentration is more than twice as high as that found in normal evaporated seawater. The bromine mineralization of the brine is distributed throughout the porous intervals of the upper and middle Smackover on the property. The strong permeability and porosity of the Smackover grainstones provide excellent continuity of the bromine mineralization within the brine. The facilities at Magnolia consist of brine production and injection wells, brine ponds, two bromine processing plants, pipelines between the plants and wells, a laboratory, storage and warehouses, administrative offices, as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment. Our Magnolia facilities are supplied electricity from a local company and we currently have several operating freshwater wells nearby that supply water to the facilities. In addition, both plants have dedicated rail spurs that provide access to several rail lines to transport product throughout the country. We consider the condition of all of our plants, facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct, and we maintain them regularly. As of December 31, 2023, the gross asset value of our facilities at our Magnolia site was approximately $932.5 million. 50 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries A summary of the Magnolia facility’s bromine mineral reserves as of December 31, 2023 is shown in the following table. RPS served as the QP and prepared the estimates of bromine mineral reserves at the Magnolia facility, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. A copy of the QP’s most recent technical report summary with respect to the bromine mineral resource and reserve estimates at the Magnolia facility, dated February 14, 2023, with an effective date of December 31, 2023, is filed as Exhibit 96.6 to this report. The amounts represent Albemarle’s attributable portion based on a 100% ownership percentage, and are presented as metric tonnes in thousands. There are no mineral resource estimates at the Magnolia, AR bromine extraction site. All bromine mineral accumulations of economic interest and with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction within the Magnolia production lease area are either currently on production or subject to an economically viable future development plan and are classified as mineral reserves. Amount (‘000s metric tonnes) Proven mineral reserves 2,706 Probable mineral reserves 611 Total mineral reserves 3,317 • Reserves are reported as bromine, on an in situ basis. • The estimated economic cutoff grade utilized for reserve reporting purposes is 1,000 mg/L bromine, with a bromine price ranging from $1,938 to $3,525 per metric tonne and operating costs ranging from $1,328 to $1,992 per metric tonne. • Recovery factors for the Magnolia are 82% and 88% for the proven mineral reserves and total mineral reserves, respectively. • The concentration of bromine at the Magnolia site varies based on the physical location of the field and can range up to over 6,000 mg/L. The Magnolia total mineral reserves of 3.3 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2023 increased by 11% from 3.0 million metric tonnes at December 31, 2022. The increase in total mineral reserves was driven by an update of the reserve model for expanded leasing, partially offset by depletion of the reserve during 2023. Additional information about key assumptions and parameters relating to the bromine mineral reserves at the Magnolia facility is discussed in section 12 of the Magnolia technical report summary. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are involved in litigation incidental to our business and are a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, product liability and breach of contract. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, the information set forth under Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.

The following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. A discussion of our consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “Financial Condition and Liquidity.” 55 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Overview We are a leading global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly-engineered specialty chemicals that are designed to meet our customers’ needs across a diverse range of end markets. Our corporate purpose is making the world safe and sustainable by powering the potential of people. The end markets we serve include energy storage, petroleum refining, consumer electronics, construction, automotive, lubricants, pharmaceuticals and crop protection. We believe that our commercial and geographic diversity, technical expertise, access to high-quality resources, innovative capability, flexible, low-cost global manufacturing base, experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate. Secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio, broad geographic presence and customer-focused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings growth. We continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative, yet commercially viable, clean energy products and services to the marketplace to contribute to our sustainable revenue. For example, our Energy Storage business contributes to the growth of clean miles driven with electric vehicles and more efficient use of renewable energy through grid storage; Specialties enables the prevention of fires starting in electronic equipment, greater fuel efficiency from rubber tires and the reduction of emissions from coal fired power plants; and our Ketjen business creates efficiency of natural resources through more usable products from a single barrel of oil, enables safer, greener production of alkylates used to produce more environmentally-friendly fuels, and reduced emissions through cleaner transportation fuels. We believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements, among other factors, position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur, while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment. 2023 Highlights • In the first quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend for the 29th consecutive year, to $0.40 per share. • We announced the official brand launch of Ketjen, a wholly owned subsidiary, previously known as the Catalysts reportable segment. • We realigned our Lithium and Bromine global business units into a new corporate structure designed to better meet customer needs and foster talent required to deliver in a competitive global environment. This resulted in the following three reportable segments: (1) Energy Storage; (2) Specialties; and (3) Ketjen. • We entered into a definitive agreement with Ford Motor Company to deliver battery-grade lithium hydroxide to support the automaker's ability to scale electric vehicle (“EV”) production. Albemarle will supply more than 100,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide for approximately three million future Ford EV batteries. The five-year supply agreement starts in 2026 and continues through 2030. • We announced a $90 million critical materials award from the U.S. Department of Defense to support the restart of Kings Mountain, N.C. mine. This award is in addition to the previously announced nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to support the construction of a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at Kings Mountain, N.C. • We signed agreements with Caterpillar Inc. to collaborate on solutions to support the full circular battery value chain and sustainable mining operations. The collaboration aims to support our effort to establish Kings Mountain, N.C. as the first-ever zero-emissions lithium mine site in North America. It also makes our North-American-produced lithium available for use in Caterpillar battery production. • We amended the MARBL lithium joint venture with MRL to acquire the remaining 40% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with MRL through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50% of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. In connection with this restructuring, we paid MRL approximately $380 million in cash. • Our Meishan, China lithium conversion plant achieved mechanical completion in December 2023 and has moved to the commissioning phase. • We recorded net sales of $9.6 billion during 2023, an increase of 31% from the prior year. • Cash flows from operations in 2023 were $1.3 billion. Outlook The current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve. In particular, we believe that the market for lithium battery and energy storage, particularly for EVs, remains strong, providing the 56 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity. The other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions, such as slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, crude oil price fluctuation, a dynamic pricing environment, an ever-changing landscape in electronics, the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards. During the course of 2023, lithium index pricing dropped significantly. Amidst these dynamics, and despite recent downward lithium price pressure, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We believe that our businesses remain well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets. At this time, the current situation in the Middle East has resulted in our business operations continuing as normal with some shipping and raw material delays. We are monitoring the situation and will continue to make efforts to protect the safety of our employees and the health of our business. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the chief operating decision maker evaluated performance, forecasting and making resource allocation decisions based on our previously announced realignment of the Lithium and Bromine global business units. The new corporate structure was designed to better meet customer needs and foster talent required to deliver in a competitive global environment. The realignment resulted in the following three reportable segments: (1) Energy Storage; (2) Specialties; and (3) Ketjen. Energy Storage: We expect Energy Storage net sales and profitability to decrease year-over-year in 2024 if lithium market prices remain at their low current levels. Due to many of our contracts being index-referenced and variable-priced, our business is more aligned with changes in market and index pricing. The first part of 2023 saw record high lithium price levels which increased prior year results, helping drive the expected decrease in year-over-year comparisons. As a result, increases or further decreases in lithium market pricing could have a material impact on our results. We do expect the lower pricing to be partially offset by higher sales volume driven primarily by additional capacity from La Negra, Chile, Kemerton, Western Australia, and Qinzhou, China, as well as additional tolling volume supported by increased spodumene production out of Australia. The Meishan, China lithium conversion plant achieved mechanical completion and has moved to the commissioning phase. In addition, lower expected earnings are driven by higher variable costs, primarily due to the higher market pricing of salts and spodumene expected to be realized during the year. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a $604 million charge to reduce the value of certain spodumene and finished goods to their net realizable value following the decline in lithium market pricing at the end of the year. We could record additional inventory valuation charges in 2024 if lithium prices continue to deteriorate during the projected period of conversion and sale. While we ramp up our new capacity, we will continue to utilize tolling arrangements to meet growing customer demand. EV sales are expected to continue to increase over the prior year as the lithium battery market remains strong. In addition, we completed the amendment of the MARBL joint venture in Australia. The restructured agreements, among other things, increase our interest in the first two conversion trains of the Kemerton processing plant from 60% to 100%. Following the transaction, we hold a 50% ownership interest in the Wodgina Lithium Mine Project. On a longer-term basis, we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plug-in hybrid EVs and full battery EVs increases. This demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium-ion battery costs, increasing battery performance, continuing significant investments in the battery and EV supply chain by cathode and battery producers and automotive OEMs and favorable global public policy toward e-mobility/renewable energy usage. Our outlook is also bolstered by long-term supply agreements with key strategic customers, reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner, highlighted by our scale, access to geographically diverse, low-cost resources and long-term track record of reliability of supply and operating execution. Specialties: We expect both net sales and profitability to be relatively flat in 2024 as we recover from reduced customer demand in certain markets, including consumer and industrial electronics, and maintain strong demand in other end-markets, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture and oilfield services. We have taken measures to reduce the negative impact of lower demand, which we expect to show positive impacts in 2024. On a longer-term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety, bromine and lithium specialties products. We are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive production networks to serve all major bromine and lithium specialties consuming products and markets. The combination of our solid, long-term business fundamentals, strong cost position, product 57 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries innovations and effective management of raw material costs should enable us to manage our business through end-market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets. Ketjen: Total Ketjen results in 2024 are expected to increase year-over-year due to higher pricing, while raw material and energy costs stabilized during 2023. In addition, volume is expected to grow across each of the Ketjen businesses. The FCC market has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of increased travel and depletion of global gasoline inventories. HPC demand tends to be lumpier than FCC demand, but we have seen increased demand as refineries are taking turnarounds. Additionally, we have signed an agreement to supply unique technologies to new markets, such as the hydrotreated vegetable oil market, which supports the energy transition for sustainable aviation fuels and supports our business growth. Our decision to retain this business as a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary is intended to better meet customer needs and foster the talent required to deliver in a competitive global environment. On a longer-term basis, we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels, new refinery start-ups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our Ketjen business. We believe delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry. We also believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world, including those managing new contaminants present in North America tight oil, and those in the Middle East and Asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields. Longer-term, we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour, a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio. With superior technology and production capacities, and expected growth in end market demand, we believe that Ketjen remains well-positioned for the future. In PCS, we expect growth on a longer-term basis in our organometallics business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending. Corporate: We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. We expect our global effective tax rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the United States, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the recently released Pillar II effective in 2024, and other tax jurisdictions. In January 2024 we announced that we are taking measures to unlock near term cash flow and generate long-term financial flexibility by re-phasing organic growth investments and optimizing our cost structure. This includes a reduction of planned capital expenditures in 2024 to focus on significantly progressed, near completion and in startup projects, while deferring spending on certain projects such as the previously announced mega-flex facility in Richburg, South Carolina and the Albemarle Technology Park in Charlotte, North Carolina. In addition, we announced that we are pursuing actions to optimize our cost structure, aiming to reduce costs by approximately $95 million annually, including a reduction in headcount and lower spending on contracted services. Actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are reflected in Corporate as a component of non-operating pension and OPEB plan costs under mark-to-market accounting. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 include an actuarial gain of $10.2 million ($8.3 million after income taxes), as compared to a loss of $37.0 million ($26.5 million after income taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2022. We remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint.

We have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. Effective January 1, 2023 our reportable business segments consisted of: (1) Energy Storage, (2) Specialties and (3) Ketjen. The segment information for the prior year periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. The below segment information also includes a discussion of our segment net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 for the realigned Energy Storage and Specialties segments. 61 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the operating segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments, All Other, and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit (“Non-operating pension and OPEB items”) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs. Our chief operating decision maker uses adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to assess the ongoing performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources. We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis. These non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration-related costs, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, certain litigation and arbitration costs and charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. We have reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides additional useful measurements to review the Company’s operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Total adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Total adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

joint venture Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements. 66 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Property, Plant and Equipment. We assign the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method, with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves, which are depleted on a units-of-production method. We evaluate the recovery of our property, plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Acquisition Method of Accounting . We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses. Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash flows and discount rates, among other items. When acquiring mineral reserves, the fair value is estimated using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the specific operation. Management’s cash flow projections involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected production of the mine over the estimated time period, sales prices, shipment volumes, and expected profit margins. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the preliminary fair value assigned to mineral reserves. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. For more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Income Taxes. We assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings, and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions. Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined primarily on the first-in, first-out basis. Cost is determined on the weighted-average basis for a small portion of our inventories at foreign plants and our stores, supplies and other inventory. A portion of our domestic produced finished goods and raw materials are determined on the last-in, first-out basis. If management estimates that the market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market pricing and demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is recorded in an inventory reserve with an expense recorded to Cost of goods sold. Environmental Remediation Liabilities. We estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site-specific facts and circumstances. Cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing (i) the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter, (ii) the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and (iii) the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility. Asset Retirement Obligations. Certain of our sites are subject to various laws and regulations, including legal and contractual obligations to reclaim, remediate, or otherwise restore properties at the time the property is removed from service. The fair value recorded is estimated based on cost information obtained both internally and externally. These estimates are inflated based the assumed timing of the obligation payments and discounted using on available risk-free discount rate at the time. We review our assumptions and estimates of these costs periodically or if we become aware of material changes to these obligations. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers. A performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer. The transaction price of a contract, or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments, if applicable, for any variable consideration, such as 67 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries customer rebates, noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer, although these adjustments are generally not material. Where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, although these situations are rare and are generally not built into our contracts. Any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material. Standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers, which in some cases are based on established market prices. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue. Our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days, however, they vary by market factors, such as customer size, creditworthiness, geography and competitive environment. All of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers, and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery. Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. Our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices, while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs. Such costs are immaterial. The Company currently utilizes the following practical expedients, as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : • All sales and other pass-through taxes are excluded from contract value; • In utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year; • We will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component (which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income) unless, if at contract inception, the expected payment terms (from time of delivery or other relevant criterion) are more than one year; • If our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance, we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right; and • We expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costs/compensation attributable to individual product sales/shipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less. Certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer. In management’s judgment, control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time (upon shipment or delivery) and not over the time they are produced. Therefore, revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products. Costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less. When the Company incurs pre-production or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable, such costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which is less than one year. We record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance, which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to not be amortized. We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management. In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company initially performs a qualitative test (“Step 0”), where it first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative test (“Step 1”). During Step 1, the Company 68 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries estimates the fair value using a discounted cash flow model. Future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate as well as other economic or industry-related factors. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and financing expense, income tax expenses, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis.For the Refining Solutions reporting unit, within the Ketjen segment, the revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. The Company uses a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing. The WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective. The factors in this calculation are largely external to the Company and, therefore, are beyond its control. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis. The Company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2023. The PCS reporting unit, within the Ketjen segment, has experienced declining earnings from a changing market. During this annual impairment test, it was determined that it is expected to experience a continued decline in its foreseeable forecast, resulting in a fair value based on the present value future cash flows that was lower than its current carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a $6.8 million impairment loss, representing the full value of goodwill associated with the PCS reporting unit. No evidence of impairment was noted for the other reporting units from the analysis. However, if the adjusted EBITDA or discount rate estimates for the Refining Solutions reporting unit negatively changed by 10%, the Refining Solutions fair value would be below its carrying value. We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names and trademarks, for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if we determine, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents and customer lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twenty-five years. Except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our Lithium business, which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. We evaluate the recovery of our definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. See Note 12, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Under authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and OPEB plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date. The primary assumptions are as follows: • Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. • Expected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently. • Rate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement. • Mortality Assumptions—Assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations. 69 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a monthly basis. The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement. During 2023, we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions. Our U.S. defined benefit plans for non-represented employees are closed to new participants, with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen. In selecting the discount rates for the U.S. plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For 2023, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate. We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2023 measurement date. In selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we look at long-term yields on AA-rated corporate bonds when available. Our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates, particularly at the longer durations. For the Eurozone, we apply the Aon Hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate. For the U.K., the discount rate is determined by applying the Aon Hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of Albemarle’s U.K. plan. In other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of high-quality corporate bonds, we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration. At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average discount rate for the U.S. and foreign pension plans decreased to 5.21% and 3.73%, respectively, from 5.46% and 4.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2022 to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2023 measurement date. The discount rate for the OPEB plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 5.21% and 5.45%, respectively. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocations of plan assets to these investments. For the years 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 6.88%, and the weighted-average expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 4.86% and 3.85%, respectively. Effective January 1, 2024, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. and foreign pension plan assets is 6.88% and 5.95%, respectively. In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of changes in inflation rates. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 3.67% and 3.67%, respectively, for our foreign pension plans. For the purpose of measuring our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations at December 31, 2023 and 2022, we used the Pri-2012 Mortality Tables along with the MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale, respectively, published by the SOA. At December 31, 2023, the assumed rate of increase in the pre-65 and post-65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was zero as the employer-paid premium caps (pre-65 and post-65) were met starting January 1, 2013. A variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued OPEB liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and OPEB cost. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions, primarily in the U.S. (in thousands): 70 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries (Favorable) Unfavorable 1% Increase 1% Decrease Increase (Decrease) in  Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease) in Benefit Cost Increase (Decrease) in  Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease) in Benefit Cost Actuarial Assumptions Discount Rate: Pension $ (60,102) $ 2,807 $ 70,816 $ (3,595) Other postretirement benefits $ (2,373) $ 126 $ 2,786 $ (155) Expected return on plan assets: Pension * $ (5,283) * $ 5,283 * Not applicable. Of the $549.6 million total pension and postretirement assets at December 31, 2023, $80.5 million, or approximately 15%, are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient. Gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets. See Note 15, “Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Income Taxes We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. In order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, we are following guidance under ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, along with any related valuation allowance. Tax effects are released from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character. Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized. We elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax liabilities for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on its deferred tax balances. We only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in Income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to the statute of limitations, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for years prior to 2020. Due to the statute of limitations, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state income tax audits prior to 2017. With respect to jurisdictions outside the U.S., several audits are in process. We have audits ongoing for the years 2014 through 2022 related to Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Germany and South Africa, some of which are for entities that have since been divested. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Since the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits are uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months. Our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related 71 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries to uncertain tax positions, relating to a number of issues, up to approximately $0.4 million as a result of closure of tax statutes. As a result of the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business in 2016, we agreed to indemnify certain income and non-income tax liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, associated with the entities sold. The associated liability is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities. See Note 16, “Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” and Note 21, “Income Taxes,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details. We have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries. Our foreign earnings are computed under U.S. federal tax earnings and profits (“E&P”) principles. In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided, as they are essentially permanent in duration. The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested. We will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws. Financial Condition and Liquidity Overview The principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs, funding working capital, and service of debt. We also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to our shareholders and have the ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances. We are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, payables and inventory. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Cash Flow Our cash and cash equivalents were $889.9 million at December 31, 2023 as compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion, $1.9 billion and $344.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2023 versus 2022 was primarily due lower earnings from the Energy Storage and Specialties segments, partially offset by lower working capital outflows and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments, primarily from the Windfield joint venture. Working capital outflows in both 2023 and 2022 were driven by higher inventory balances from higher cost spodumene and accounts receivable balances from higher net sales each year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 versus 2021 was primarily due to significantly higher earnings from the Energy Storage and Specialties segments and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments, primarily from the Windfield joint venture. This increase was partially offset by an increase in working capital outflow driven by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances from higher lithium pricing and increased sales. During 2023, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and net proceeds from net borrowings of commercial paper and long-term debt of $944.2 million funded $2.1 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, net; approximately $380 million paid to MRL for the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture; $218.5 million to resolve the legal matter with the DOJ and SEC; investments in marketable securities, primarily public equity securities, of $204.5 million; and dividends to shareholders of $187.2 million. During 2022, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and the proceeds of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and credit agreements funded $1.3 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, the repayment of long-term debt and credit agreements of $705.0 million, the net repayment of $391.7 million of commercial paper, the final payment of $332.5 million of a settlement of an arbitration ruling for a prior legal matter and dividends to shareholders of $184.4 million During 2021, cash on hand, cash provided by operations, net cash proceeds of $289.8 million from the sale of the FCS business, $388.5 million of commercial paper borrowings and the $1.5 billion net proceeds from our underwritten public offering of common stock funded debt principal payments of approximately $1.5 billion, early extinguishment of debt fees of $24.9 million, $332.5 million of a settlement of an arbitration ruling for a prior legal matter, $953.7 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, dividends to shareholders of $177.9 million, and pension and postretirement contributions of $30.3 million. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated joint venture, JBC, declared dividends of $149.7 million, $274.5 million and $274.6 million, 72 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries respectively, which resulted in dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $105.6 million, $44.2 million ($53.1 million declared in 2022 was paid in the first quarter of 2023) and $96.1 million, respectively. On October 18, 2023, the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with MRL. This updated structure is intended to significantly simplify the commercial operation agreements previously entered into, allow us to retain full control of downstream conversion assets and to provide greater strategic opportunities for each company based on their global operations and the evolving lithium market. Under the amended agreements, Albemarle acquired the remaining 40% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with Mineral Resources through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50% of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately $380 million in cash, which includes $180 million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022. On October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Qinzhou, for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou's operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tonnes of LCE and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. On May 13, 2022, the Company issued a series of notes (collectively, the “2022 Notes”) as follows: • $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 4.65% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 4.84%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2027. • $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.05% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.18%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2032. • $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.65% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.71%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2052. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes were used to repay the balance of commercial paper notes, the remaining balance of $425.0 million of the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and for general corporate purposes. The 2024 Notes were originally due to mature on December 15, 2024 and bore interest at a rate of 4.15%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million in Interest and financing expenses, representing the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2024 Notes. In addition, the loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the accelerated amortization of the interest rate swap associated with the 2024 Notes from Accumulated other comprehensive income. On June 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the FCS business to Grace for proceeds of approximately $570 million, consisting of $300 million in cash and the issuance to Albemarle of preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of $270 million. The preferred equity can be redeemed at Grace’s option under certain conditions and began accruing payment-in-kind dividends at an annual rate of 12% on June 1, 2023. On February 8, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 8,496,773 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $153.00 per share. We also granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,274,509 shares, which was exercised. The total gross proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.5 billion, before deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions. In the first quarter of 2021, we made the following debt principal payments using the net proceeds from this underwritten public offering: • €123.8 million of the 1.125% notes due in November 2025 • €393.0 million, the remaining balance, of the 1.875% Senior notes originally due in December 2021 • $128.4 million of the 3.45% senior notes due in November 2029 • $200.0 million, the remaining balance, of the floating rate notes originally due in November 2022 • €183.3 million, the outstanding balance, of the unsecured credit facility originally entered into on August 14, 2019, as amended and restated on December 15, 2020 (the “2019 Credit Facility”) • $325.0 million, the outstanding balance, of the commercial paper notes 73 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion, $1.3 billion and $953.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were incurred mainly for plant, machinery and equipment. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2024 primarily for Energy Storage growth and capacity increases, including in Australia, Chile, China and the U.S., as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to decrease from 2023, reflecting an announced new level of spending to unlock cash flow over the near term and generate long-term financial flexibility. Train I of our Kemerton, Western Australia plant is operating and producing battery-grade product subject to customer qualification. Train II has achieved mechanical completion and transitioned to the commissioning stage. In addition, our lithium conversion plant in Meishan, China has reached mechanical completion and has moved into the commissioning phase. The Company is permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15,000,000 shares under a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. There were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2023, 2022 or 2021. At December 31, 2023, there were 7,396,263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the Company’s authorized share repurchase program. Net current assets decreased to approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023 from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to lower cash balance for the uses noted above and the increase in the current portion of debt, primarily related to commercial paper borrowed. This is partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable related to value added tax and inventories. Additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates. The additional changes are not the result of any policy changes by the Company, and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents included $857.6 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. From time to time, we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we repatriated approximately $2.9 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million of cash, respectively, as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities. While we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending, including business acquisitions and other cash outlays, should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations, cash on hand and additional issuances of debt or equity securities, as needed. Long-Term Debt We currently have the following notes outstanding: Issue Month/Year Principal (in millions) Interest Rate Interest Payment Dates Maturity Date November 2019 €371.7 1.125% November 25 November 25, 2025 May 2022 (a) $650.0 4.65% June 1 and December 1 June 1, 2027 November 2019 €500.0 1.625% November 25 November 25, 2028 November 2019 (a) $171.6 3.45% May 15 and November 15 November 15, 2029 May 2022 (a) $600.0 5.05% June 1 and December 1 June 1, 2032 November 2014 (a) $350.0 5.45% June 1 and December 1 December 1, 2044 May 2022 (a) $450.0 5.65% June 1 and December 1 June 1, 2052 (a)    Denotes senior notes. Our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes 74 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of these notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of $40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default. Our Euro notes issued in 2019 are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all our other unsecured senior obligations. The Euro notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis using the bond rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 35 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness exceeding $100 million caused by a nonpayment default. Given the current economic conditions, specifically around the market pricing of lithium, and the related impact on the Company’s future earnings, on February 9, 2024 we amended our revolving, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), which provides for borrowings of up to $1.5 billion and matures on October 28, 2027. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.910% to 1.375%, depending on the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services LLC (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”). With respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, interest is calculated using the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a term SOFR adjustment of 0.10%, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.125% as of December 31, 2023. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The February 2024 amendment was entered into to modify the financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement to avoid a potential covenant violation over the following 18 months given the current market pricing of lithium. Following the February 2024 amendment, the 2022 Credit Agreement subjects the Company to two financial covenants, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The first financial covenant requires that the ratio of (a) the Company’s consolidated net funded debt plus a proportionate amount of Windfield’s net funded debt to (b) consolidated Windfield-Adjusted EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be less than or equal to (i) 3.50:1 prior to the second quarter of 2024, (ii) 5.00:1 for the second quarter of 2024, (iii) 5.50:1 for the third quarter of 2024, (iv) 4.00:1 for the fourth quarter of 2024, (v) 3.75:1 for the first and second quarters of 2025 and (vi) 3.50:1 after the second quarter of 2025. The maximum permitted leverage ratios described above are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement upon the consummation of an acquisition after June 30, 2025 if the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of $500 million. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the second financial covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be no less than 2.00:1 for fiscal quarters through June 30, 2025, and no less than 3.00:1 for all fiscal quarters thereafter. The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2022 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the commitments under the 2022 Credit Agreement being terminated. The amendments to the financial covenants assume moderate improvement to the current market pricing of lithium. If lithium market prices do not improve, or worsen, the Company may not be able to maintain compliance with its amended financial covenants and it will require the Company to seek additional amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement and/or issue debt or equity securities, as needed, to fund its activities and maintain financial flexibility. If the Company is not able to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this would lead to an 75 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries event of default and its lenders could require the Company to repay its outstanding debt. In that situation, the Company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders. On August 14, 2019, the Company entered into a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility with several banks and other financial institutions, which was amended and restated on December 15, 2020 and again on December 10, 2021 (the “2019 Credit Facility”). On October 24, 2022, the 2019 Credit Facility was terminated, with the outstanding balance of $250 million repaid using cash on hand. On May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”) from time-to-time. On May 17, 2023, we entered into definitive documentation to increase the size of our existing commercial paper program. The maximum aggregate face amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at any time is $1.5 billion (up from $750 million prior to the increase).. The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. The 2022 Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the $1.5 billion current maximum amount available under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. At December 31, 2023, we had $620.0 million of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding bearing a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 6.05% and a weighted-average maturity of 11 days. The Commercial Paper Notes are classified as Current portion of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received a loan of $300.0 million to be repaid in five equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2026. This interest-free loan was discounted using an imputed interest rate of 5.5% and the Company will amortize that discount through Interest and financing expenses over the term of the loan. When constructing new facilities or making major enhancements to existing facilities, we may have the opportunity to enter into incentive agreements with local government agencies in order to reduce certain state and local tax expenditures. Under these agreements, we transfer the related assets to various local government entities and receive bonds. We immediately lease the facilities from the local government entities and have an option to repurchase the facilities for a nominal amount upon tendering the bonds to the local government entities at various predetermined dates. The bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets are recorded in property, plant and equipment. We currently have the ability to transfer up to $540 million in assets under these arrangements. At December 31, 2023, there are $14.3 million of bonds outstanding under these arrangements. The non-current portion of our long-term debt amounted to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. In addition, at December 31, 2023, we had the ability to borrow $880.0 million under our commercial paper program and the 2022 Credit Agreement, and $104.1 million under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement. We have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt. We believe that as of December 31, 2023 we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. For additional information about our long-term debt obligations, see Note 14, “Long-Term Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately $217.2 million at December 31, 2023. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. Liquidity Outlook We generally use cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities, divestitures and borrowings to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures, make acquisitions, make pension contributions and pay dividends. We also could issue additional debt or equity securities to fund these activities in an effort to maintain our financial flexibility. Our main focus in the short-term, during the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economy, including lithium market pricing and recent inflationary trends, is to continue to maintain financial flexibility by 76 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries continuing our cost savings initiative, while still protecting our employees and customers, committing to shareholder returns and maintaining an investment grade rating. Over the next three years, in terms of uses of cash, we will continue to invest in growth of the businesses and return value to shareholders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity. Financing the purchase price of any such acquisitions could involve borrowing under existing or new credit facilities and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, in addition to cash on hand. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be down from 2023 levels, as part of an intentional re-phasing of larger projects to focus on those that are significantly progressed, near completion and in start up. We are also pursuing actions to optimize our cost structure by reducing costs primarily related to sales, general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in headcount and lower spending on contracted services, as announced in January 2024. As part of the announced reduction in headcount, we expect to record a charge of approximately $15 million to $20 million for severance and outplacement costs in the first quarter of 2024. We expect these severance payments to primarily be made during 2024. Our growth investments include strategic investments in China with plans to build a battery grade lithium conversion plant in Meishan initially targeting 50,000 metric tonnes of LCE per year. The Meishan lithium conversion plant achieved mechanical completion and has moved to the commissioning phase. We also announced the decision to build two additional processing trains at the Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant in Western Australia. The additional trains would increase the facility’s production by 50,000 metric tonnes per year. In October 2022, we announced we had been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant funding is intended to support a portion of the anticipated cost to construct a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at our Kings Mountain, North Carolina, location. We expect the concentrator facility to create hundreds of construction and full-time jobs, and to supply up to 350,000 metric tonnes per year of spodumene concentrate to our previously announced mega-flex lithium conversion facility. To further support the restart of the Kings Mountain mine, in August 2023, we announced a $90 million critical materials award from the U.S. Department of Defense. In addition, we previously announced plans to construct a new $1.3 billion lithium mega-flex processing facility in South Carolina capable of annually producing approximately 50,000 metric tonnes of battery-grade lithium hydroxide, with the potential to expand up to 100,000 metric tonnes. In December 2022, we also acquired a location in Charlotte, North Carolina, where we intend to invest at least $180 million to establish the Albemarle Technology Park, a world-class facility designed for novel materials research, advanced process development, and acceleration of next-generation lithium products to market. In January 2024 we announced that we will defer spending on both of these projects to preserve cash flow over the near term. In January 2024, the Company sold equity securities of a public company for proceeds of approximately $81.5 million. As a result of the sale, the Company expects to realize a loss of approximately $33.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Overall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and no significant long-term debt maturities before November 2025, we believe we have, and will be able to maintain a solid liquidity position. In order to maintain financial flexibility, we may issue additional debt or equity securities to fund future capital spending and other cash outlays. Our annual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions): 2024—$625.8; 2025—$416.5; 2026—$60.0; 2027—$710.0; 2028—$612.2; thereafter—$1,848.3. In addition, we expect to make interest payments on those long-term debt obligations as follows (in millions): 2024—$124.7; 2025—$124.3; 2026—$120.0; 2027—$102.5; 2028—$89.1; thereafter—$1,009.7. For variable-rate debt obligations, projected interest payments are calculated using the December 31, 2023 weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.76%. In addition, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2024, down from $2.1 billion in 2023, primarily for Energy Storage growth and capacity increases, including in Australia, Chile, China and the U.S., as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments. As of December 31, 2023, we have also committed to approximately $324.2 million of payments to third-party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes, with approximately $137.4 million to be paid in 2024. In order to secure materials, sometimes for long durations, these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe. See Note 18, “Leases,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for our annual expected payments under our operating lease obligations at December 31, 2023. 77 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries In 2024, we expect to pay $64.4 million of the $191.7 million balance remaining from the transition tax on foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law in December 2017. The one-time transition tax imposed by the TCJA is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and is payable over an eight-year period, with the final payment made in 2026. Contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans, including our supplemental executive retirement plan, are expected to approximate $14 million in 2024. We may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. We made contributions of approximately $15.5 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the year ended December 31, 2023. The liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities totaled $220.6 million and $83.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in Other assets totaled $73.0 million and $32.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time. Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions, continuing inflationary trends and reduced capital availability. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials and in transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary environment. As a result, we are planning for various economic scenarios and actively monitoring our balance sheet to maintain the financial flexibility needed. Although we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions as sources of financing, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments to us, decline funding under our existing but uncommitted lines of credit with them, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing to us. While the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong, periods of elevated uncertainty related to the stability of the banking system, future pandemics or global economic and/or geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time. If such concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. If the U.S. Federal Reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to continue tightening the monetary supply, we may incur increased borrowing costs (as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations), although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits. As first reported in 2018, following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third-party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business, within what is now the Ketjen segment, we investigated and voluntarily self-reported potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC, and also reported this conduct to the Dutch Public Prosecutor. We cooperated with these agencies in their investigations of this historical conduct and implemented appropriate remedial measures intended to strengthen our compliance program and related internal controls. In September 2023, the Company finalized agreements to resolve these matters with the DOJ and SEC. The DPP has confirmed it will not pursue action in this matter. In connection with this resolution, which relates to conduct prior to 2018, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and an administrative resolution with the SEC, pursuant to which we paid a total of $218.5 million in aggregate fines, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest to the DOJ and SEC. The resolution does not include a compliance monitorship, although the Company has agreed to certain ongoing compliance reporting obligations. The agreed upon amounts were paid to the DOJ and SEC in October 2023, with this matter considered finalized and no future financial obligations expected. We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $889.9 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $857.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. This cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access. The cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the U.S. We anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the U.S. in excess of our cash held in the U.S. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing U.S. credit facilities or our commercial paper program. 78 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Guarantor Financial Information Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd Issued Notes Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd (the “Issuer”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “3.45% Senior Notes”) in November 2019. The 3.45% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantee”) on a senior unsecured basis by Albemarle Corporation (the “Parent Guarantor”). No direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor guarantee the 3.45% Senior Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”). In 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 60% interest in Wodgina in Western Australia and formed an unincorporated joint venture with MRL, named MARBL Lithium Joint Venture, for the exploration, development, mining, processing and production of lithium and other minerals (other than iron ore and tantalum) from the Wodgina spodumene mine and for the operation of the Kemerton assets in Western Australia. We participate in Wodgina through our ownership interest in the Issuer. On October 18, 2023 we amended the joint venture agreements, resulting in a decrease of our ownership interest in the MARBL joint venture and Wodgina to 50%. The Parent Guarantor conducts its U.S. Specialties and Ketjen operations directly, and conducts its other operations (other than operations conducted through the Issuer) through the Non-Guarantors. The 3.45% Senior Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Issuer, effectively subordinated to all of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. The Guarantee is the senior unsecured obligation of the Parent Guarantor and ranks equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, effectively subordinated to the secured debt of the Parent Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. For cash management purposes, the Parent Guarantor transfers cash among itself, the Issuer and the Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Issuer and/or the Parent Guarantor’s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan. The following tables present summarized financial information for the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a Non-Guarantor. Each entity in the combined financial information follows the same accounting policies as described herein. Summarized Statement of Operations Year ended December 31, $ in thousands 2023 Net sales (a) $ 2,392,057 Gross profit 802,653 Loss before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (b) 254,066 Net loss attributable to the Guarantor and the Issuer (216,033) (a)    Includes net sales to Non-Guarantors of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. (b)    Includes intergroup expenses to Non-Guarantors of $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 79 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Summarized Balance Sheet At December 31, $ in thousands 2023 Current assets (a) $ 723,518 Net property, plant and equipment 2,246,404 Other non-current assets (b) 2,619,575 Current liabilities (c) $ 2,374,074 Long-term debt 2,252,540 Other non-current liabilities (d) 7,409,175 (a)    Includes receivables from Non-Guarantors of $293.8 million at December 31, 2023. (b)    Includes non-curent receivables from Non-Guarantors of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023. (c)    Includes current payables to Non-Guarantors of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023. (d)    Includes non-current payables to Non-Guarantors of $6.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The 3.45% Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Non-Guarantors. The Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the 3.45% Senior Notes or the Indenture under which the 3.45% Senior Notes were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that the Parent Guarantor has to receive any assets of any of the Non-Guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any Non-Guarantor, and the consequent rights of holders of the 3.45% Senior Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of a Non-Guarantor’s assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such Non-Guarantor’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests, if any, of such Non-Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Non-Guarantors, the Non-Guarantors will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests, if any, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Parent Guarantor. The 3.45% Senior Notes are obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer’s cash flow and ability to make payments on the 3.45% Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings it derives from the production from MARBL for Wodgina. Absent income received from sales of its share of production from MARBL, the Issuer’s ability to service the 3.45% Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries and other joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to the Issuer in the form of equity, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from the Issuer. The Issuer’s obligations in respect of MARBL are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor. Further, under MARBL pursuant to a deed of cross security between the Issuer, the joint venture partner and the manager of the project (the “Manager”), each of the Issuer, and the joint venture partner have granted security to each other and the Manager for the obligations each of the Issuer and the joint venture partner have to each other and to the Manager. The claims of the joint venture partner, the Manager and other secured creditors of the Issuer will have priority as to the assets of the Issuer over the claims of holders of the 3.45% Senior Notes. Albemarle Corporation Issued Notes In March 2021, Albemarle New Holding GmbH (the “Subsidiary Guarantor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, added a full and unconditional guarantee (the “Upstream Guarantee”) to all securities of Albemarle Corporation (the “Parent Issuer”) issued and outstanding as of such date and, subject to the terms of the applicable amendment or supplement, securities issuable by the Parent Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”). No other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer guarantee these securities (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Upstream Non-Guarantors”). See Long-term debt section above for a description of the securities issued by the Parent Issuer. The current securities outstanding under the Indenture are the Parent Issuer’s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Parent Issuer. All securities currently outstanding under the Indenture are effectively subordinated to the Parent Issuer’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. With respect to any series of securities issued under the Indenture that is subject to the Upstream Guarantee (which series of securities does not include the 2022 Notes), the Upstream Guarantee is, and will be, an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor, ranking pari passu with all other existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor. 80 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries All securities currently outstanding under the Indenture (other than the 2022 Notes) are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent’s Subsidiaries other than the Subsidiary Guarantor. The 2022 Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent’s Subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Guarantor. For cash management purposes, the Parent Issuer transfers cash among itself, the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Upstream Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Parent Issuer and/or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Parent Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan. The following tables present summarized financial information for the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Parent Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is an Upstream Non-Guarantor. Summarized Statement of Operations Year ended December 31, $ in thousands 2023 Net sales (a) $ 1,297,308 Gross profit 68,743 Loss before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (b) (444,249) Net loss attributable to the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Parent Issuer (697,911) (a)    Includes net sales to Non-Guarantors of $482.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. (b)    Includes intergroup income from Non-Guarantors of $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(d)    Includes non-current payables to Non-Guarantors of $6.4 billion at December 31, 2023. These securities are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Upstream Non-Guarantors. The Upstream Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to these securities or the Indenture under which these securities were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that the Subsidiary Guarantor has to receive any assets of any of the Upstream Non-Guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any Upstream Non-Guarantors, and the consequent rights of holders of these securities to realize proceeds from the sale of any of an Upstream Non-Guarantor’s assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such Upstream Non-Guarantor’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests, if any, of such Upstream Non-Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Upstream Non-Guarantors, the Upstream Non-Guarantors will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests, if any, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Subsidiary Guarantor. 81 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Safety and Environmental Matters We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not currently expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition. Our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were $73.0 million, $46.3 million and $43.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures, and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years. Costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities, which at December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $34.1 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from $38.2 million at December 31, 2022. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis, although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period. Capital expenditures for pollution-abatement and safety projects, including such costs that are included in other projects, were approximately $116.7 million, $75.6 million and $55.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the future, capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals. Management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution-abatement and safety regulations are subject to (a) the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and (b) uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful, or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Australian Dollar, Chilean Peso and Japanese Yen. In response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods, we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings. We manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use, from time to time, of foreign currency forward contracts. The principal objective of such contracts is to 82 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. We do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges, in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures. In the event a natural hedge is not available, we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure, generally expiring within one year. While these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of non-functional currency purchases during the construction of the Kemerton plant in Australia. This contract has been designated as an effective hedging instrument, and beginning the date of designation, gains or losses on the revaluation of this contract to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. All other gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as an effective hedging instrument are recognized in Other income (expenses), net, and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations. At December 31, 2023, our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of $8.1 billion and with a fair value representing a net asset position of $12.1 million. The aggregate notional value of foreign currency forward contracts increased in 2022 due to increased balance sheet exposure from higher sales and income in foreign-denominated currencies. Fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10% change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. A 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies would result in a decrease of approximately $86.1 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. The sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of December 31, 2023, without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions. When those anticipated transactions are realized, actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods. On December 18, 2014, the carrying value of our 1.875% Euro-denominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the Euro serves as the functional currency, and beginning on the date of designation, gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In the first quarter of 2021, we repaid the outstanding balance of these senior notes, and as a result, this net investment hedge was discontinued. The balance of foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses associated with this discontinued net investment hedge will remain within Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated. We are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies. We had variable interest rate borrowings of $650.2 million and $3.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These borrowings represented 15% and less than 1% of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 5.76% and 0.07% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately $6.5 million as of December 31, 2023. We may enter into interest rate swaps, collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs. Our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. Historically, we have not used futures, options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. However, the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide long-term protection against changes in natural gas and metals prices. We seek to limit our exposure by entering into long-term contracts when available, and we seek price increase limitations through contracts. These contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations. 83 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with management’s and our directors’ authorizations; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework 2013 set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. / S / J. K ENT M ASTERS J. Kent Masters Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) February 14, 2024 84 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Albemarle Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Albemarle Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of  December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 85 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Refining Solutions Reporting Unit As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $1,629.7 million as of December 31, 2023, and the goodwill associated with the Refining Solutions reporting unit was $172.6 million. Management tests the Company’s recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company’s reporting units below their carrying amounts. Management performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2023 by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the related carrying value. Management estimates the fair value using a discounted cash flow model. For the Refining Solutions reporting unit, the revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization) margins, and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Refining Solutions reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Refining Solutions reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, and the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Refining Solutions reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Refining Solutions reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, and the discount rate. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates and adjusted EBITDA margins involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Refining Solutions reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Charlotte, North Carolina February 14, 2024 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994. 86 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 Net sales $ 9,617,203 $ 7,320,104 $ 3,327,957 Cost of goods sold (a) 8,431,294 4,245,517 2,329,986 Gross profit 1,185,909 3,074,587 997,971 Selling, general and administrative expenses 919,493 524,145 441,482 Research and development expenses 85,725 71,981 54,026 (Gain) loss on change in interest in properties/sale of business, net ( 71,190 ) 8,400 ( 295,971 ) Operating profit 251,881 2,470,061 798,434 Interest and financing expenses ( 116,072 ) ( 122,973 ) ( 61,476 ) Other income (expenses), net 110,929 86,356 ( 603,340 ) Income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 246,738 2,433,444 133,618 Income tax expense 430,277 390,588 29,446 Income before equity in net income of unconsolidated investments ( 183,539 ) 2,042,856 104,172 Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) 1,854,082 772,275 95,770 Net income 1,670,543 2,815,131 199,942 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 97,067 ) ( 125,315 ) ( 76,270 ) Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation $ 1,573,476 $ 2,689,816 $ 123,672 Basic earnings per share $ 13.41 $ 22.97 $ 1.07 Diluted earnings per share $ 13.36 $ 22.84 $ 1.06 Weighted-average common shares outstanding—basic 117,317 117,120 115,841 Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 117,766 117,793 116,536 (a) Included purchases from related unconsolidated affiliates of $ 2.3 billion, $ 656.7 million and $ 156.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

91 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1— Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Albemarle Corporation and our wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “Albemarle,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” mean Albemarle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. For entities that we control and are the primary beneficiary, but own less than 100%, we record the minority ownership as noncontrolling interest, except as noted below. We apply the equity method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest from 20% to 50% or where we exercise significant influence over the related investee’s operations. In addition, the consolidated financial statements contained herein include our proportionate share of the results of operations of the MARBL Lithium Joint Venture (“MARBL”), which manages the exploration, development, mining, processing and production of lithium and other minerals from the Wodgina hard rock lithium mine project (“Wodgina”). As described in Note 10, “Investments,” the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited (“MRL”) on October 18, 2023 to reduce our ownership interest in the MARBL joint venture to 50 % from 60 %. The consolidated financial statements reflect our ownership percentage of the MARBL joint venture during the periods presented. The joint venture is unincorporated with each investor holding an undivided interest in each asset and proportionately liable for each liability; therefore our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are included in the appropriate classifications in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Estimates, Assumptions and Reclassifications The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States (“U.S.”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers. A performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer. The transaction price of a contract, or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments, if applicable, for any variable consideration, such as customer rebates, noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer, although these adjustments are generally not material. Where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, although these situations are rare and are generally not built into our contracts. Any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material. Standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers, which in some cases are based on established market prices. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue. Our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days, however, they vary by market factors, such as customer size, creditworthiness, geography and competitive environment. All of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers, and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery. Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. Our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices, while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs. Such costs are immaterial. The Company currently utilizes the following practical expedients, as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : • All sales and other pass-through taxes are excluded from contract value; • In utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year; 92 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • We will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component (which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income) unless, if at contract inception, the expected payment terms (from time of delivery or other relevant criterion) are more than one year; • If our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance, we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right; and • We expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costs/compensation attributable to individual product sales/shipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less. Certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have limited alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer. In management’s judgment, control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time (upon shipment or delivery) and not over the time they are produced. Therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products. Costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less. When the Company incurs pre-production or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable, such costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which is less than one year. We record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation. Included in Trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is approximately $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, arising from contracts with customers. The remaining balance of Trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily includes value-added taxes collected from customers on behalf of various taxing authorities. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market investments with insignificant interest rate risks and no limitations on access. Inventories Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined primarily on the first-in, first-out basis. Cost is determined on the weighted-average basis for a small portion of our inventories at foreign plants and our stores, supplies and other inventory. A portion of our domestic produced finished goods and raw materials are determined on the last-in, first-out basis. The Company eliminates the balance of intra-entity profits on purchases of inventory from its equity method investments that remains unsold at the balance sheet in Inventories, specifically finished goods and equally reduces Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) on the consolidated statements of income. The intra-entity profit is recognized in Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) in the period that converted inventory is sold to a third-party customer. In the same period, the intra-entity profit is also recognized as higher Cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment include costs of assets constructed, purchased or leased under a finance lease, related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on significant capital projects during their construction periods. Expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized, but expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with yearly planned major maintenance are generally deferred and amortized over 12 months or until the same major maintenance activities must be repeated, whichever is shorter. The cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in income. We assign the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method, with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves, which are depleted on a units-of-production method. We evaluate the recovery of our property, plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events 93 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As an implicit rate for most of our leases is not determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease payments for the initial measurement of lease ROU assets and lease liabilities include fixed and variable payments based on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments that are not index or rate based are recorded as expenses when incurred. Our variable lease payments typically include real estate taxes, insurance costs and common-area maintenance. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made, net of lease incentives. The lease term is the non-cancelable period of the lease, including any options to extend, purchase or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We amortize the operating lease ROU assets on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease and the finance lease ROU assets on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, we have made accounting policy elections such as exclusion of short-term leases (leases with a term of 12 months or less and which do not include a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise) from the balance sheet presentation, use of portfolio approach in determination of discount rate and accounting for non-lease components in a contract as part of a single lease component for all asset classes, except specific mining operation equipment. Resource Development Expenses We incur costs in resource exploration, evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects. Exploration costs incurred before the declaration of proven and probable resources are generally expensed as incurred. After proven and probable resources are declared, exploration, evaluation and development costs necessary to bring the property to commercial capacity or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized. Any costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred. Capitalized resource costs are depleted using the units-of-production method. Our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Investments Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investments in equity-method investees in the consolidated balance sheets as Investments and our share of investees’ earnings or losses together with other-than-temporary impairments in value as Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments in the consolidated statements of income. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Certain investments in equity securities and mutual fund investments are accounted for as trading equities and are marked-to-market on a periodic basis through the consolidated statements of income. Investments in joint ventures and nonmarketable securities of immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis. Environmental Compliance and Remediation Environmental compliance costs include the cost of purchasing and/or constructing assets to prevent, limit and/or control pollution or to monitor the environmental status at various locations. These costs are capitalized and depreciated based on estimated useful lives. Environmental compliance costs also include maintenance and operating costs with respect to pollution 94 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS prevention and control facilities and other administrative costs. Such operating costs are expensed as incurred. Environmental remediation costs of facilities used in current operations are generally immaterial and are expensed as incurred. We accrue for environmental remediation costs and post-remediation costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations at facilities or off-plant disposal sites in the accounting period in which responsibility is established and when the related liability is considered probable and estimable. In developing these cost estimates, we evaluate currently available facts regarding each site, with consideration given to existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and other factors, subject to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process. If the amount and timing of the cash payments for a site are fixed or reliably determinable, the liability is discounted, if the calculated discount is material. Additionally, these estimates are reviewed periodically, with adjustments to the accruals recorded as necessary. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expenses related to present and future products are expensed as incurred. These expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and other overheads, as well as outside service and consulting costs incurred for specific programs. Our U.S. facilities in Texas and Louisiana and our global facilities in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Korea form the capability base for our contract research and custom manufacturing businesses. These business areas provide research and scale-up services primarily to innovative life science companies. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance that requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets not be amortized. We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management. In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company initially performs a qualitative test (“Step 0”), where it first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative test (“Step 1”). During Step 1, the Company estimates the fair value using a discounted cash flow model. Future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate as well as other economic or industry-related factors. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and financing expense, income tax expenses, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis. For the Refining Solutions reporting unit, the revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. The Company uses a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing. The WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective. The factors in this calculation are largely external to the Company and, therefore, are beyond its control. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis. The Company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2023. The performance catalyst solutions (“PCS”) reporting unit, within the Ketjen segment, has experienced declining earnings from a changing market. During this annual impairment test, it was determined that it is expected to experience a continued decline in its foreseeable forecast, resulting in a fair value based on the present value future cash flows that was lower than its current carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a $ 6.8 million impairment loss, representing the full value of goodwill associated with the PCS reporting unit. No evidence of impairment was noted for the other reporting units from the analysis. However, if the adjusted EBITDA or discount rate estimates for the Refining Solutions reporting unit negatively changed by 10%, the Refining Solutions fair value would be below its carrying value. The Company assesses its indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names and trademarks, for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is 95 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment standard allows the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if we determine, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis for the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets. Definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents and customer lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twenty-five years . Except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our Energy Storage business, which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. We evaluate the recovery of our definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. See Note 12, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.” Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Under authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit (“OPEB”) plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date. The primary assumptions are as follows: • Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. • Expected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans, as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently. • Rate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement. • Mortality Assumptions—Assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a monthly basis. The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement. During 2023, we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions. In selecting the discount rates for the U.S. plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For 2023, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate. We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2023 measurement date. In selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we look at long-term yields on AA-rated corporate bonds when available. Our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields on the constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates, particularly at the longer durations. For the Eurozone, we apply the Aon Hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate. For the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the discount rate is determined by applying the Aon Hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of Albemarle’s U.K. plan. In other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of high-quality corporate bonds, we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration. 96 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. For the purpose of measuring our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations at December 31, 2023 and 2022, we used the Pri-2012 Mortality Tables along with the MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale, respectively, published by the SOA. Stock-based Compensation Expense The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of performance unit awards with a service condition and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. To the extent restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses. Income Taxes We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, along with any related valuation allowance. Tax effects are released from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character. Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized. The Company elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax liabilities for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on its deferred tax balances. We only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Under current accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions, interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in Income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. We have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries. Our foreign earnings are computed under U.S. federal tax earnings and profits, or E&P, principles. In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration. The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested. We will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Accumulated other comprehensive loss comprises principally foreign currency translation adjustments, gains or losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges designated as effective hedging instruments, amounts related to the revaluation of our euro-denominated senior notes which were designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations in 2014, a realized loss on a forward starting interest rate swap entered into in 2014 which was designated as a cash flow hedge, and deferred income taxes related to the aforementioned items. 97 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries were prepared in their respective functional currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates, while income and expenses were translated at average exchange rates for the periods presented. Translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of equity. Foreign exchange transaction and revaluation gains (losses) were $ 39.9 million, ($ 21.8 ) million and $ 0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in Other income (expenses), net, in our consolidated statements of income, with the unrealized portion included in Other, net, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Derivative Financial Instruments We manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use of foreign currency forward contracts from time to time, which generally expire within one year . The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are generally expected to be offset by changes in the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged. Gains or losses under foreign currency forward contracts that have been designated as an effective hedging instrument under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging will be recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss beginning on the date of designation. All other gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as an effective hedging instrument are recognized currently in Other income (expenses), net, and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations. We may also enter into interest rate swaps, collars or similar instruments from time to time, with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs. The counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. We do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of non-functional currency purchases during the construction of the Kemerton plant in Australia and designated it as an effective hedging instrument under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . All other foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022 have not been designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance that provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The guidance applies only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued additional accounting guidance which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The guidance under both FASB issuances was originally effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. However, in December 2022, the FASB issued an update to defer the sunset date of this guidance to December 31, 2024. The Company currently does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued guidance on how to recognize and measure acquired contract assets and liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination, which requires the acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those annual periods. This guidance does not currently, nor is it expected to, have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expands the Company’s abilities to hedge the benchmark interest rate risk of portfolios of financial assets or beneficial interests in a fair value hedge. This guidance expands the use of the portfolio layer method to allow multiple hedges of a single closed portfolio of assets using spot starting, forward starting, and amortizing-notional swaps. This also permits both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets to be included in the closed portfolio of assets hedged in a portfolio layer hedge. In addition, this guidance requires that basis adjustments not be allocated to individual assets for active portfolio layer method hedges, but rather be maintained on the closed portfolio of assets 98 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as a whole. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those annual periods. This guidance does not currently, nor is it expected to, have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2023, the FASB issued guidance requiring the Company to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control leases over the asset’s useful life to the common control group regardless of the lease term. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company currently does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2023, the FASB issued guidance which will require a joint venture to recognize and initially measure its assets, including goodwill, and liabilities using a new basis of accounting upon formation. Initial measurement of a joint venture’s total net assets will be equal to the fair value of one hundred percent of the joint venture’s equity. In addition, a joint venture will be permitted to apply the measurement period guidance of ASC 805-10 if the initial accounting for the joint venture formation is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the formation occurs. This guidance is effective prospectively for all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. The Company currently does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to update qualitative and quantitative reportable segment disclosure requirements, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and increased interim disclosure requirements, among others. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments should be applied retrospectively. The Company currently does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statement disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to require qualitative and quantitative updates to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, among others, in order to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures, including consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disaggregation by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is also permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures. NOTE 2— Acquisitions: Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials Acquisition On October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. (“Qinzhou”), for approximately $ 200 million in cash, which included the deferral of approximately $ 29 million. The full amount of the deferral, net of working capital adjustments, was paid in installments ending in July 2023. Qinzhou's operations include a lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. The aggregate purchase price noted above was allocated to the major categories of assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition closing date, which were based, in part, upon third-party appraisals for certain assets. The fair value of the assets and liabilities was primarily related to Property, plant and equipment of $ 106.6 million, Other intangibles of $ 16.3 million, net current liabilities of $ 5.5 million, and long-term liabilities of $ 7.1 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was $ 76.8 million and was recorded as Goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price was finalized in the third quarter of 2023. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to possible impairment. Goodwill arising from the acquisition was recorded within the Energy Storage segment and consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale from the combined companies and overall strategic importance of the acquired businesses to Albemarle. The goodwill attributable to the acquisition will not be amortizable or deductible for tax purposes. 99 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Acquisition, integration and potential divestiture related costs Acquisition, integration and potential divestiture related costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 of $ 26.8 million, $ 16.3 million and $ 12.7 million were included primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, on our consolidated statements of income. These include costs for the Qinzhou acquisitions noted above, as well as various other completed or potential acquisitions and divestitures. NOTE 3— Divestitures: On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its fine chemistry services (“FCS”) business to W. R. Grace & Co. (“Grace”) for proceeds of approximately $ 570 million, consisting of $ 300 million in cash and the issuance to Albemarle of preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of $ 270 million. The preferred equity can be redeemed at Grace’s option under certain conditions and began accruing payment-in-kind (“PIK”) dividends at an annual rate of 12 % on June 1, 2023. This preferred equity can be redeemed by Albemarle when the accumulated balance reaches 200% of its original value. The balance of this preferred equity is reported in Investments in the consolidated balance sheets. As part of the transaction, Grace acquired our manufacturing facilities located in South Haven, Michigan and Tyrone, Pennsylvania. The sale of the FCS business reflects the Company’s commitment to investing in its core, growth-oriented business segments. During the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded a gain of $ 428.4 million ($ 330.9 million after taxes) related to the sale of this business. The results of operations of the business classified as held for sale are included in the consolidated statements of income through June 1, 2021. This business did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment because the Company’s management does not consider the sale as representing a strategic shift that had or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.

Included in the calculation of basic earnings per share are unvested restricted stock awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends. At December 31, 2023, there were 4,500 unvested shares of restricted stock awards outstanding. We have the authority to issue 15 million shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series. As of December 31, 2023, no shares of preferred stock have been issued. On February 8, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 8,496,773 shares of our common stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, at a price to the public of $ 153.00 per share.

(b) During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $ 604.1 million charge in Cost of goods sold to reduce the value of certain spodumene and finished goods to their net realizable value following the decline in lithium market pricing at the end of the year. Approximately 3 % of our inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The portion of our domestic inventories stated on the LIFO basis amounted to $ 60.4 million and $ 52.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are below replacement cost by approximately $ 60.1 million and $ 57.9 million, respectively. The Company eliminates the balance of intra-entity profits on purchases of inventory from its equity method investments that remains unsold at the balance sheet in Inventories, specifically finished goods and equally reduces Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) on the consolidated statements of income. The balance of intra-entity profits on inventory purchased from equity method investments in Inventories totaled $ 559.6 million and $ 332.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The intra-entity profit is recognized in Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) in the period that converted inventory is sold to a third-party customer. In the same period, the intra-entity profit is also recognized as higher Cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income.

The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated generally by the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral rights is based on the units-of-production method. Depreciation expense, including depletion, amounted to $ 398.5 million, $ 273.0 million and $ 225.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest capitalized on significant capital projects in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 72.7 million, $ 31.1 million and $ 50.0 million, respectively. In October 2022, the Company announced it has been awarded a nearly $ 150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs and the electric grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant funding is intended to support a portion of the anticipated cost to construct a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at our Kings Mountain, North Carolina location. The grant will be received over the life of the construction period for the new facility (projected as 2024 to 2026) as reimbursement for capital expenditures. To further support the restart of the Kings Mountain mine, in August 2023, we announced a $ 90 million critical materials award from the U.S. Department of Defense. As funds are received for both of these grants, the Company will reduce the cost of the assets by the amount of the grant, and income will be recognized by the lower depreciation expense over the useful life of the assets. NOTE 10— Investments: Investments include our share of unconsolidated joint ventures, nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities. The following table details the Company’s investment balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): December 31, 2023 2022 Joint ventures $ 855,131 $ 832,119 Available for sale debt securities 289,307 260,139 Nonmarketable securities 18,389 18,760 Marketable equity securities 207,028 39,535 Total $ 1,369,855 $ 1,150,553 103 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company’s ownership positions in significant unconsolidated investments are shown below: December 31, 2023 2022 2021 * Windfield Holdings Pty.

Undistributed earnings attributable to our significant unconsolidated investments represented approximately $ 97.3 million and $ 242.7 million of our consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All of the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have investments are private companies and accordingly do not have a quoted market price available. The following summary lists the assets, liabilities and results of operations for the Company’s significant unconsolidated joint ventures presented herein (in thousands): December 31, 2023 2022 Summary of Balance Sheet Information: Current assets $ 1,424,059 $ 1,927,791 Noncurrent assets 2,321,261 1,659,692 Total assets $ 3,745,320 $ 3,587,483 Current liabilities $ 773,931 $ 770,211 Noncurrent liabilities 1,267,271 1,175,773 Total liabilities $ 2,041,202 $ 1,945,984 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Summary of Statements of Income Information: Net sales $ 7,019,117 $ 4,290,223 $ 827,848 Gross profit $ 6,373,472 $ 3,765,304 $ 443,129 Income before income taxes $ 5,988,737 $ 3,301,875 $ 269,788 Net income $ 4,224,961 $ 2,314,094 $ 187,084 104 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We have evaluated each of the unconsolidated investments pursuant to current accounting guidance and none qualify for consolidation. Dividends received from our significant unconsolidated investments were $ 2.0 billion, $ 800.9 million and $ 78.4 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company holds a 49 % equity interest in Windfield, which we acquired in the Rockwood acquisition. With regards to the Company’s ownership in Windfield, the parties share risks and benefits disproportionate to their voting interests. As a result, the Company considers Windfield to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”). However, the Company does not consolidate Windfield as it is not the primary beneficiary. The carrying amount of our 49 % equity interest in Windfield, which is our most significant VIE, was $ 712.0 million and $ 694.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s unconsolidated VIEs are reported in Investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not guarantee debt for, or have other financial support obligations to, these entities, and its maximum exposure to loss in connection with its continuing involvement with these entities is limited to the carrying value of the investments. Proportionately Consolidated Joint Ventures On October 18, 2023, the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with MRL. This updated structure is intended to significantly simplify the commercial operation agreements previously entered into, allow us to retain full control of downstream conversion assets and to provide greater strategic opportunities for each company based on their global operations and the evolving lithium market. Under the amended agreements, Albemarle acquired the remaining 40 % ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with MRL through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50 % of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately $ 380 million in cash, which includes $ 180 million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $ 71.2 million on the consolidated statement of income during the fourth quarter of 2023. The fair value of the 40 % ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility was based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to possible impairment. This joint venture is unincorporated with each investor holding an undivided interest in each asset and proportionately liable for each liability; therefore our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are included in the appropriate classifications in the consolidated financial statements. Public Equity Securities Included in the Company’s marketable equity securities balance are holdings in equity securities of public companies. The fair value is measured using publicly available share prices of the investments, with any changes reported in Other income (loss), net in our consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company purchased approximately $ 203.4 million of shares in publicly-traded companies. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded unrealized mark-to-market (losses) gains of ($ 41.4 ) million and $ 4.3 million, respectively, in Other income (loss), net for all public equity securities held at the end of the balance sheet date. In January 2024, the Company sold equity securities of a public company for proceeds of approximately $ 81.5 million. As a result of the sale, the Company expects to realize a loss of $ 33.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Other The Company holds a 50 % equity interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited (“JBC”), reported in the Bromine segment. The Company consolidates this venture as it is considered the primary beneficiary due to its operational and financial control. On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its FCS business to Grace for proceeds of approximately $ 570 million, consisting of $ 300 million in cash and the issuance to Albemarle of preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of $ 270 million. The preferred equity can be redeemed at Grace’s option under certain conditions and 105 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS will accrue PIK dividends at an annual rate of 12 % beginning June 1, 2023, two years after issuance. The fair value of this preferred equity was $ 289.3 million and $ 260.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We maintain a Benefit Protection Trust (the “Trust”) that was created to provide a source of funds to assist in meeting the obligations of our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (“EDCP”), subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency. Assets of the Trust, in conjunction with our EDCP, are accounted for as trading securities in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance.

The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 4.84 %. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2027. • $ 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.05 % payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.18 %. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2032. 108 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • $ 450.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.65 % payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.71 %. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2052. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes were used to repay the balance of the commercial paper notes, the remaining balance of $ 425.0 million of the 4.15 % Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and for general corporate purposes. The 2024 Notes were originally due to mature on December 15, 2024 and bore interest at a rate of 4.15 %. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 19.2 million in Interest and financing expenses, representing the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2024 Notes. In addition, the loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the accelerated amortization of the interest rate swap associated with the 2024 Notes from Accumulated other comprehensive income. 2019 Notes On November 25, 2019, the Company issued a series of notes (collectively, the “2019 Notes”) as follows: • $ 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes, bearing interest at a floating rate, which were fully repaid in the first quarter of 2021, as noted below. • € 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes, bearing interest at a rate of 1.125 % payable annually on November 25 of each year, beginning in 2020. The effective interest rate on these notes is approximately 1.30 %. These notes mature on November 25, 2025. These notes were partially repaid in the first quarter of 2021, as noted below. • € 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes, bearing interest at a rate of 1.625 % payable annually on November 25 of each year, beginning in 2020. The effective interest rate on these notes is approximately 1.74 %. These notes mature on November 25, 2028. • $ 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 3.45 % payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning in 2020. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 3.58 %. These senior notes mature on November 15, 2029. These notes were partially repaid in the first quarter of 2021, as noted below. 2014 Senior Notes We currently have outstanding $ 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on November 24, 2014, bearing interest at a rate of 5.45 % payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2015. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.50 %. These senior notes mature on December 1, 2044. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company made certain debt principal payments using proceeds from the February 2021 underwritten public offering of common stock. As a result, included in Interest and financing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 is a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 29.0 million representing the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of this debt. On January 22, 2014, we entered into a pay fixed, receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swap, with a notional amount of $ 325.0 million, with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., to be effective October 15, 2014. Our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge was to eliminate the variability in the interest rate and partial credit spread on the 20 future semi-annual coupon payments that were to be paid in connection with the 2024 Notes. On October 15, 2014, the swap was settled, resulting in a payment to the counterparty of $ 33.4 million. This amount was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and was to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. As noted above, the 2024 Notes were repaid in the second quarter of 2022, and as a result, the unamortized balance of this interest rate swap was reclassified to interest expense during the same period as part of the early extinguishment of debt. Prior to repayment in the first quarter of 2021, the carrying value of the 1.875 % Euro-denominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries where the Euro serves as the functional currency, and gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon repayment of these notes, this net investment hedge was discontinued. The balance of foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses associated with this discontinued net investment hedge will remain within accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated. Prior to the net investment hedge being discontinued a gain of $ 5.1 million (net of income taxes), during the year ended December 31, 2021, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 109 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Credit Agreements Given the current economic conditions, specifically around the market pricing of lithium, and the related impact on the Company’s future earnings, on February 9, 2024 we amended our revolving, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), which provides for borrowings of up to $ 1.5 billion and matures on October 28, 2027. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.910 % to 1.375 %, depending on the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services LLC (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”). With respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, interest is calculated using the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a term SOFR adjustment of 0.10 %, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.125 % as of December 31, 2023. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The February 2024 amendment was entered into to modify the financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement to avoid a potential covenant violation over the following 18 months given the current market pricing of lithium. Following the February 2024 amendment, the 2022 Credit Agreement subjects the Company to two financial covenants, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The first financial covenant requires that the ratio of (a) the Company’s consolidated net funded debt plus a proportionate amount of Windfield’s net funded debt to (b) consolidated Windfield-Adjusted EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be less than or equal to (i) 3.50 :1 prior to the second quarter of 2024, (ii) 5.00 :1 for the second quarter of 2024, (iii) 5.50 :1 for the third quarter of 2024, (iv) 4.00 :1 for the fourth quarter of 2024, (v) 3.75 :1 for the first and second quarters of 2025 and (vi) 3.50 :1 after the second quarter of 2025. The maximum permitted leverage ratios described above are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement upon the consummation of an acquisition after June 30, 2025 if the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of $ 500 million. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the second financial covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be no less than 2.00 :1 for fiscal quarters through June 30, 2025, and no less than 3.00 :1 for all fiscal quarters thereafter. The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2022 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the commitments under the 2022 Credit Agreement being terminated. The amendments to the financial covenants assume moderate improvement to the current market pricing of lithium. If lithium market prices do not improve, or worsen, the Company may not be able to maintain compliance with its amended financial covenants and it will require the Company to seek additional amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement and/or issue debt or equity securities, as needed, to fund its activities and maintain financial flexibility. If the Company is not able to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this would lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the Company to repay its outstanding debt. In that situation, the Company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders. On August 14, 2019, the Company entered into a $ 1.2 billion unsecured credit facility with several banks and other financial institutions, which was amended and restated on December 15, 2020 and again on December 10, 2021 (the “2019 Credit Facility”). On October 24, 2022, the 2019 Credit Facility was terminated, with the outstanding balance of $ 250 million repaid using cash on hand. Commercial Paper Notes On May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”) from time-to-time. On May 17, 2023, we entered into definitive documentation to increase the size of our existing commercial paper program. The maximum aggregate face amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at any time is $ 1.5 billion (up from $ 750 million prior to the increase). The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. The 2022 Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the $ 1.5 billion current maximum amount available under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days. At December 31, 2023, we had $ 620.0 million of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding bearing a 110 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS weighted-average interest rate of approximately 6.05 % and a weighted-average maturity of 11 days. The Commercial Paper Notes are classified as Current portion of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023. Other In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received a loan of $ 300.0 million to be repaid in five equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2026. This interest-free loan was discounted using an imputed interest rate of 5.53 % and the Company will amortize that discount through Interest and financing expenses over the term of the loan. We have additional uncommitted credit lines with various U.S. and foreign financial institutions that provide for borrowings of up to approximately $ 279.8 million at December 31, 2023. Outstanding borrowings under these agreements were $ 30.2 million and $ 3.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The average interest rate on borrowings under these agreements during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately 0.4 %. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022. At December 31, 2023, we had the ability to borrow $ 880.0 million under our commercial paper program and the Credit Agreements. We believe that as of December 31, 2023, we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. NOTE 15— Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits: We maintain various noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees, primarily in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Japan. We also have a contributory defined benefit plan covering certain Belgian employees. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on compensation and/or years of service. Our U.S. and U.K. defined benefit plans for non-represented employees are closed to new participants, with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen. The funding policy for each plan complies with the requirements of relevant governmental laws and regulations. The pension information for all periods presented includes amounts related to salaried and hourly plans. The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status, as well as a summary of significant assumptions, for our defined benefit pension plans (in thousands): 111 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022 U.S. Pension Plans Foreign Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Foreign Pension Plans Change in benefit obligations: Benefit obligation at January 1 $ 514,971 $ 180,561 $ 680,696 $ 255,234 Service cost 499 5,686 904 3,700 Interest cost 26,924 7,153 18,827 3,363 Actuarial gain 11,957 10,078 ( 144,288 ) ( 49,380 ) Benefits paid ( 41,449 ) ( 9,051 ) ( 41,168 ) ( 11,049 ) Employee contributions — 60 — 64 Foreign exchange loss (gain) — 7,137 — ( 18,562 ) Settlements/curtailments — ( 5,606 ) — ( 1,028 ) Other — ( 100 ) — ( 1,781 ) Benefit obligation at December 31 $ 512,902 $ 195,918 $ 514,971 $ 180,561 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at January 1 $ 469,828 $ 58,229 $ 605,991 $ 94,256 Actual return on plan assets 54,785 4,395 ( 95,925 ) ( 29,694 ) Employer contributions 967 14,496 930 12,451 Benefits paid ( 41,449 ) ( 9,051 ) ( 41,168 ) ( 11,049 ) Employee contributions — 60 — 64 Foreign exchange gain (loss) — 3,091 — ( 9,004 ) Settlements/curtailments — ( 5,606 ) — ( 1,028 ) Other — ( 100 ) — 2,233 Fair value of plan assets at December 31 $ 484,131 $ 65,514 $ 469,828 $ 58,229 Funded status at December 31 $ ( 28,771 ) $ ( 130,404 ) $ ( 45,143 ) $ ( 122,332 ) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 U.S. Pension Plans Foreign Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Foreign Pension Plans Amounts recognized in consolidated balance sheets: Current liabilities (accrued expenses) $ ( 912 ) $ ( 7,951 ) $ ( 947 ) $ ( 6,957 ) Noncurrent liabilities (pension benefits) ( 27,859 ) ( 122,453 ) ( 44,196 ) ( 115,375 ) Net pension liability $ ( 28,771 ) $ ( 130,404 ) $ ( 45,143 ) $ ( 122,332 ) Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income: Prior service benefit $ — $ ( 531 ) $ — $ ( 615 ) Net amount recognized $ — $ ( 531 ) $ — $ ( 615 ) Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31: Discount rate 5.21 % 3.73 % 5.46 % 4.04 % Rate of compensation increase — % 3.67 % — % 3.67 % The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $ 700.4 million and $ 688.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Postretirement medical benefits and life insurance is provided for certain groups of U.S. retired employees. Medical and life insurance benefit costs have been funded principally on a pay-as-you-go basis. Although the availability of medical coverage after retirement varies for different groups of employees, the majority of employees who retire before becoming eligible for Medicare can continue group coverage by paying a portion of the cost of a monthly premium designed to cover the claims incurred by retired employees subject to a cap on payments allowed. The availability of group coverage for Medicare- 112 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS eligible retirees also varies by employee group with coverage designed either to supplement or coordinate with Medicare. Retirees generally pay a portion of the cost of the coverage. Plan assets for retiree life insurance are held under an insurance contract and are reserved for retiree life insurance benefits. In 2005, the postretirement medical benefit available to U.S. employees was changed to provide that employees who are under age 50 as of December 31, 2005 would no longer be eligible for a company-paid retiree medical premium subsidy. Employees who are of age 50 and above as of December 31, 2005 and who retire after January 1, 2006 will have their retiree medical premium subsidy capped. Effective January 1, 2008, our medical insurance for certain groups of U.S. retired employees is now insured through a medical carrier.

The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2023 was primarily attributable to a higher return on pension plan assets during the year than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was 11.21 % versus an expected return of 6.66 %. This was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate to 5.21 % from 5.46 % for our U.S. pension plans and to 3.73 % from 4.04 % for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2023 measurement date. The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2022 was primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted average discount rate to 5.46 % from 2.86 % for our U.S. pension plans and to 4.04 % from 1.44 % for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2022 measurement date. This was partially offset by a lower return on pension plan assets in 2022 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was ( 17.94 )% versus an expected return of 6.48 %. The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2021 was primarily attributable to a higher return on pension plan assets in 2021 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was 8.42 % versus an expected return of 6.50 %. In addition, there was an increase in the weighted-average discount rate to 2.86 % from 2.50 % for our U.S. pension plans and to 1.44 % from 0.86 % for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2021 measurement date. 114 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability We endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing price on the last business day of the year. Listed securities for which no sale was reported on such date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and asked price. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the closing price on the last business day of the year or at bid price. The net asset value of shares or units is based on the quoted market value of the underlying assets. The market value of corporate bonds is based on institutional trading lots and is most often reflective of bid price. Government securities are valued at the mean between bid and ask prices. Holdings in private equity securities are typically valued using the net asset valuations provided by the underlying private investment companies. The following tables set forth the assets of our pension and postretirement plans that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): December 31, 2023 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Items (Level 1) Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Similar Items (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Pension Assets: Domestic Equity (a) $ 58,906 $ 58,906 $ — $ — International Equity (b) 106,491 99,432 7,059 — Fixed Income (c) 294,140 257,299 36,841 — Absolute Return Measured at Net Asset Value (d) 80,542 — — — Cash 9,566 9,566 — — Total Pension Assets $ 549,645 $ 425,203 $ 43,900 $ — December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Items (Level 1) Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Similar Items (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Pension Assets: Domestic Equity (a) $ 98,080 $ 97,984 $ 96 $ — International Equity (b) 88,002 79,815 8,187 — Fixed Income (c) 269,352 235,184 34,168 — Absolute Return Measured at Net Asset Value (d) 68,725 — — — Cash 3,898 3,898 — — Total Pension Assets $ 528,057 $ 416,881 $ 42,451 $ — (a) Consists primarily of U.S. stock funds that track or are actively managed and measured against the S&P 500 index.

(c) Consists primarily of debt obligations issued by governments, corporations, municipalities and other borrowers. Also includes insurance policies. (d) Consists primarily of funds with holdings in private investment companies. See additional information about the Absolute Return investments below. Holdings in private investment companies are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient and have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Their fair values are included in this table to permit reconciliation to the reconciliation of plan assets table above. 115 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s pension plan assets in the U.S. and U.K. represent approximately 96 % of the total pension plan assets. The investment objective of these pension plan assets is to achieve solid returns while preserving capital to meet current plan cash flow requirements. Assets should participate in rising markets, with defensive action in declining markets expected to an even greater degree. Depending on market conditions, the broad asset class targets may range up or down by approximately 10 %. These asset classes include but are not limited to hedge fund of funds, bonds and other fixed income vehicles, high yield fixed income securities, equities and distressed debt. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, equity securities held by our pension and OPEB plans did not include direct ownership of Albemarle common stock. The weighted-average target allocations as of the measurement date are as follows: Target Allocation Equity securities 38 % Fixed income 53 % Absolute return 9 % Our Absolute Return investments consist primarily of our investments in hedge fund of funds. These are holdings in private investment companies with fair values that are based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. Investment managers or fund managers associated with these investments provide valuations of the investments on a monthly basis utilizing the net asset valuation approach for determining fair values. These valuations are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness based on applicable sector, benchmark and company performance to validate the appropriateness of the net asset values as a fair value measurement. Where available, audited financial statements are obtained and reviewed for the investments as support for the manager’s investment valuation. In general, the investment objective of these funds is high risk-adjusted returns with an emphasis on preservation of capital. The investment strategies of each of the funds vary; however, the objective of our Absolute Return investments is complementary to the overall investment objective of our U.S. pension plan assets. We made contributions to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans of $ 17.9 million, $ 16.1 million and $ 30.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect contributions to our domestic nonqualified and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans to approximate $ 14.2 million in 2024. Also, we expect to pay approximately $ 2.4 million in premiums to our U.S. postretirement benefit plan in 2024. However, we may choose to make additional voluntary pension contributions in excess of these amounts. The current forecast of benefit payments, which reflects expected future service, amounts to (in thousands): U.S. Pension Plans Foreign Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefits 2024 $ 43,432 $ 13,476 $ 2,446 2025 $ 43,600 $ 11,493 $ 2,425 2026 $ 43,399 $ 11,753 $ 2,400 2027 $ 42,985 $ 12,322 $ 2,368 2028 $ 42,350 $ 12,716 $ 2,330 2029-2033 $ 197,112 $ 66,160 $ 10,884 We have a supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”), which provides unfunded supplemental retirement benefits to certain management or highly compensated employees. The SERP provides for incremental pension benefits to offset the limitations imposed on qualified plan benefits by federal income tax regulations. Costs (credits) relating to our SERP were $ 0.6 million, ($ 1.2 ) million and ($ 0.2 ) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The projected benefit obligation for the SERP recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 6.2 million and $ 6.5 million, respectively. The benefit expenses and obligations of this SERP are included in the tables above. Benefits of $ 0.9 million are expected to be paid to SERP retirees in 2024. On October 1, 2012, our Board of Directors approved amendments to the SERP, such that effective December 31, 2014, no additional benefits shall accrue under this plan and participants’ accrued benefits shall be frozen as of that date to reflect the same changes as were made under the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan. At December 31, 2023, the assumed rate of increase in the pre-65 and post-65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was zero as the employer-paid premium caps (pre-65 and post-65) were met starting January 1, 2013. 116 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Defined Contribution Plans On March 31, 2004, a new defined contribution pension plan benefit was adopted under the qualified defined contribution plan for U.S. non-represented employees hired after March 31, 2004. On October 1, 2012, our Board of Directors approved certain plan amendments, such that effective January 1, 2013, the defined contribution pension plan benefit is expanded to include non-represented employees hired prior to March 31, 2004, and revised the contribution for all participants to be based on 5 % of eligible employee compensation. The employer portion of contributions to our U.S. defined contribution pension plan amounted to $ 17.8 million, $ 12.1 million, and $ 16.7 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contributions in 2021 included amounts deferred from 2020 as a result of the Company’s plan to maintain financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of our employees participate in our defined contribution 401(k) employee savings plan, which is generally available to all U.S. full-time salaried and non-union hourly employees and to employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provides for such participation. This U.S. defined contribution plan is funded with contributions made by the participants and us. Our contributions to the 401(k) plan amounted to $ 18.4 million, $ 12.7 million and $ 17.4 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contributions in 2021 included amounts deferred from 2020 as a result of the Company’s plan to maintain financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiemployer Plan Prior to 2022, certain current and former employees participated in a multiemployer plan in Germany, the Pensionskasse Dynamit Nobel Versicherungsverein auf Gegenseitigkeit, Troisdorf (“DN Pensionskasse”) that provided monthly payments in the case of disability, death or retirement. On January 1, 2022, the Company terminated its membership with the DN Pensionskasse and as a result did not make any contributions during the year. In prior years, the majority of the Company’s contributions to the DN Pensionskasse were tied to employees’ contributions, which are generally calculated as a percentage of base compensation, up to a certain statutory ceiling. Our normal contributions to this plan were $ 1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Effective July 1, 2016, the DN Pensionskasse was subject to a financial improvement plan, which expired on December 31, 2022, with the final contribution in the second quarter of 2023. This financial improvement plan called for increased capital reserves to avoid future underfunding risk. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company made contributions for its employees covered under this plan of $ 0.4 million, $ 2.8 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a result of this financial improvement plan. NOTE 16— Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities consist of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): December 31, 2023 2022 Transition tax on foreign earnings (a) $ 127,339 $ 191,708 Operating leases (b) 113,681 99,269 Liabilities related to uncertain tax positions (c) 220,555 83,670 Executive deferred compensation plan obligation 33,564 27,270 Environmental liabilities (d) 23,224 31,272 Asset retirement obligations (d) 88,703 79,522 Tax indemnification liability (e) 14,481 66,137 Deferred revenue 78,027 — Other (f) 69,526 57,748 Total $ 769,100 $ 636,596 (a) Noncurrent portion of one-time transition tax on foreign earnings.

(f) No individual component exceeds 5 % of total liabilities. 117 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17— Commitments and Contingencies: In the ordinary course of business, we have commitments in connection with various activities. We believe that amounts recorded are adequate for known items which might become due in the current year. The most significant commitments are as follows: Environmental We had the following activity in our recorded environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of year $ 38,245 $ 46,617 $ 45,771 Expenditures ( 3,393 ) ( 10,378 ) ( 2,752 ) Accretion of discount 1,094 1,031 960 Additions, liability releases and changes in estimates, net ( 2,541 ) 673 4,063 Foreign currency translation adjustments and other 744 302 ( 1,425 ) Balance, end of year 34,149 38,245 46,617 Less amounts reported in Accrued expenses 10,925 6,973 9,077 Amounts reported in Other noncurrent liabilities $ 23,224 $ 31,272 $ 37,540 Environmental remediation liabilities included discounted liabilities of $ 27.4 million and $ 30.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, discounted at rates with a weighted-average of 3.7 % and 3.4 %, respectively, with the undiscounted amount totaling $ 55.4 million and $ 57.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For certain locations where the Company is operating groundwater monitoring and/or remediation systems, prior owners or insurers have assumed all or most of the responsibility. The amounts recorded represent our future remediation and other anticipated environmental liabilities. These liabilities typically arise during the normal course of our operational and environmental management activities or at the time of acquisition of the site, and are based on internal analysis as well as input from outside consultants. As evaluations proceed at each relevant site, changes in risk assessment practices, remediation techniques and regulatory requirements can occur, therefore such liability estimates may be adjusted accordingly. The timing and duration of remediation activities at these sites will be determined when evaluations are completed. Although it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of these remediation liabilities, management estimates (based on the latest available information) that there is a reasonable possibility that future environmental remediation costs associated with our past operations could represent an additional $ 47 million before income taxes, in excess of amounts already recorded. We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded would likely occur over a period of time and would likely not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period. 118 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Asset Retirement Obligations The following is a reconciliation of our beginning and ending asset retirement obligation balances for 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Balance, beginning of year $ 80,101 $ 79,213 Additions and changes in estimates 11,288 2,919 Accretion of discount 2,421 1,996 Liabilities settled ( 3,044 ) ( 4,266 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments and other ( 1,607 ) 239 Balance, end of year $ 89,159 $ 80,101 Less amounts reported in Accrued expenses 456 579 Amounts reported in Other noncurrent liabilities $ 88,703 $ 79,522 Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to post-closure reclamation of brine wells and sites involved in the surface mining and manufacturing of lithium. We are not aware of any conditional asset retirement obligations that would require recognition in our consolidated financial statements. Litigation We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business, including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, products liability, breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation. Where appropriate, we may establish financial reserves for such proceedings. We also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks. Costs for legal services are generally expensed as incurred. On February 6, 2017, Huntsman International LLC (“Huntsman”), a subsidiary of Huntsman Corporation, filed a lawsuit in New York state court against Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (“Rockwood”), Rockwood Specialties, Inc., certain former executives of Rockwood and its subsidiaries, Seifollah Ghasemi, Thomas Riordan, Andrew Ross, and Michael Valente, and Albemarle. The lawsuit arises out of Huntsman’s acquisition of certain Rockwood subsidiaries in connection with a stock purchase agreement (the “SPA”), dated September 17, 2013. Before that transaction closed on October 1, 2014, Albemarle began discussions with Rockwood to purchase all outstanding equity of Rockwood and did so in a transaction that closed on January 12, 2015. Huntsman’s complaint asserted that certain technology that Rockwood had developed for a production facility in Augusta, Georgia, and which was among the assets that Huntsman acquired pursuant to the SPA, did not work, and that Rockwood and the defendant executives had intentionally misled Huntsman about that technology in connection with the Huntsman-Rockwood transaction. The complaint asserted claims for, among other things, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of the SPA, and sought certain costs for completing construction of the production facility. On March 10, 2017, Albemarle moved in New York state court to compel arbitration, which was granted on January 8, 2018 (although Huntsman unsuccessfully appealed that decision). Huntsman’s arbitration demand asserted claims substantially similar to those asserted in its state court complaint, and sought various forms of legal remedies, including cost overruns, compensatory damages, expectation damages, punitive damages, and restitution. After a trial, the arbitration panel issued an award on October 28, 2021, awarding approximately $ 600 million (including interest) to be paid by Albemarle to Huntsman, in addition to the possibility of attorney’s fees, costs and expenses. Following the arbitration panel decision, Albemarle reached a settlement with Huntsman to pay $ 665 million in two equal installments, with the first payment made in December 2021. The second and final payment of $ 332.5 million was made in May 2022. As a result, the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes expense of $ 657.4 million ($ 508.5 million net of income tax), inclusive of estimated possible legal fees incurred by Huntsman and other related obligations, to reflect the increase in liabilities for this legal matter. As first reported in 2018, following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third-party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business, within what is now the Ketjen segment, we investigated and voluntarily self-reported potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC, and also reported this conduct to the Dutch Public Prosecutor (“DPP”). We cooperated with these 119 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS agencies in their investigations of this historical conduct and implemented appropriate remedial measures intended to strengthen our compliance program and related internal controls. In September 2023, the Company finalized agreements to resolve these matters with the DOJ and SEC. The DPP has confirmed it will not pursue action in this matter. In connection with this resolution, which relates to conduct prior to 2018, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and an administrative resolution with the SEC, pursuant to which we paid a total of $ 218.5 million in aggregate fines, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest to the DOJ and SEC. The resolution does not include a compliance monitorship, although the Company has agreed to certain ongoing compliance reporting obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a charge of $ 218.5 million in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in its consolidated statement of operations and accrued a corresponding liability on its consolidated balance sheet for these agreements. The agreed upon amounts were paid to the DOJ and SEC in October 2023, with this matter considered finalized and no future financial obligations expected. Indemnities We are indemnified by third parties in connection with certain matters related to acquired and divested businesses. Although we believe that the financial condition of those parties who may have indemnification obligations to the Company is generally sound, in the event the Company seeks indemnity under any of these agreements or through other means, there can be no assurance that any party who may have obligations to indemnify us will adhere to their obligations and we may have to resort to legal action to enforce our rights under the indemnities. The Company may be subject to indemnity claims relating to properties or businesses it divested, including properties or businesses of acquired businesses that were divested prior to the completion of the acquisition. In the opinion of management, and based upon information currently available, the ultimate resolution of any indemnification obligations owed to the Company or by the Company is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company had approximately $ 14.5 million and $ 66.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities primarily related to the indemnification of certain income and non-income tax liabilities associated with the Chemetall Surface Treatment entities sold in 2017. Other The Company has standby letters of credit and guarantees with various financial institutions. The following table summarizes our letters of credit and guarantee agreements (in thousands): 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Letters of credit and other guarantees $ 193,648 $ 13,375 $ 2,454 $ 868 $ 717 $ 6,088 The outstanding letters of credit are primarily related to insurance claim payment guarantees. The majority of the Company’s other guarantees have terms of one year and mainly consist of performance and environmental guarantees, as well as guarantees to customs and port authorities. The guarantees arose during the ordinary course of business. We do not have recorded reserves for the letters of credit and guarantees as of December 31, 2023. We are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential future liability under guarantees and letters of credit. However, we accrue for any potential loss for which we believe a future payment is probable and a range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe our liability under such obligations is immaterial. We currently, and are from time to time, subject to transactional audits in various taxing jurisdictions and to customs audits globally. We do not expect the financial impact of any of these audits to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. NOTE 18— Leases: We lease certain office space, buildings, transportation and equipment in various countries. The initial lease terms generally range from 1 to 30 years for real estate leases, and from 2 to 15 years for non-real estate leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 120 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Many leases include options to terminate or renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 1 to 50 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The following table provides details of our lease contracts for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 48,238 $ 43,809 $ 42,338 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right of use assets 5,302 3,377 614 Interest on lease liabilities 5,070 3,504 3,010 Total finance lease cost 10,372 6,881 3,624 Short-term lease cost 20,309 13,985 11,084 Variable lease cost 25,075 8,064 8,002 Total lease cost $ 103,994 $ 72,739 $ 65,048 Supplemental cash flow information related to our lease contracts for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 49,261 $ 36,629 $ 33,030 Operating cash flows from finance leases 4,671 3,389 1,776 Financing cash flows from finance leases 2,165 1,432 687 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 48,655 15,913 56,814 Finance leases 46,773 3,976 17,096 121 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Supplemental balance sheet information related to our lease contracts, including the location on balance sheet, at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands, except as noted): December 31, 2023 2022 Operating leases: Other assets $ 137,405 $ 128,173 Accrued expenses 30,583 35,515 Other noncurrent liabilities 113,681 99,269 Total operating lease liabilities 144,264 134,784 Finance leases: Net property, plant and equipment 112,438 81,356 Current portion of long-term debt (a) 9,702 4,995 Long-term debt 104,484 74,409 Total finance lease liabilities 114,186 79,404 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years): Operating leases 12.2 13.3 Finance leases 20.7 22.8 Weighted average discount rate (%): Operating leases 4.74 % 3.60 % Finance leases 4.71 % 4.41 % (a)    Balance includes accrued interest of finance lease.

Stock options granted to employees generally vest over three years and have a term of ten years . Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards vest in periods ranging from one to five years from the date of grant. Performance unit awards are earned at a level ranging from 0 % to 200 % contingent upon the achievement of specific performance criteria over periods ranging from one to three years . Distribution of earned units occurs generally 50 % upon completion of the applicable measurement period with the remaining 50 % distributed one year thereafter. In May 2017, the Company adopted the Albemarle Corporation 2017 Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), which replaced the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan. The maximum number of shares available for issuance to participants 122 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS under the Incentive Plan is 4,500,000 shares. The adoption of the Incentive Plan did not affect awards already granted under the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan. In February 2023, the Company adopted the Albemarle Corporation 2023 Stock Compensation and Deferral Election Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “Non-Employee Directors Plan”). The Non-Employee Directors Plan replaced the 2013 Stock Compensation and Deferral Election Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which expired by its terms in May 2023. Under the Non-Employee Directors Plan, a maximum aggregate number of 500,000 shares of our common stock is authorized for issuance to the Company’s non-employee directors; any shares remaining available for issuance under the prior plans were canceled. The aggregate fair market value of shares that may be issued to a director during any compensation year (as defined in the Non-Employee Directors Plan, generally July 1 to June 30) shall not exceed $ 750,000 . At December 31, 2023, there were 3,072,368 shares available for grant under the Incentive Plan and 493,250 shares available for grant under the Non-Employee Directors Plan. Total stock-based compensation expense associated with our incentive plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $ 39.0 million, $ 31.4 million and $ 18.8 million, respectively, and is included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Total related recognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $ 4.6 million, $ 4.0 million and $ 2.3 million, respectively. The following table summarizes information about the Company’s fixed-price stock options as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023: Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2022 384,936 $ 114.24 6.3 $ 39,501 Granted 51,316 249.52 Exercised ( 3,124 ) 59.41 Forfeited ( 5,984 ) 207.12 Outstanding at December 31, 2023 427,144 $ 129.59 5.8 $ 14,891 Exercisable at December 31, 2023 314,745 $ 102.14 4.9 $ 14,891 We granted 51,316 , 57,348 and 62,479 stock options during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no significant modifications made to any share-based grants during these periods. The fair value of each option granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Dividend yield 1.26 % 1.32 % 1.43 % Volatility 40.06 % 36.21 % 36.19 % Average expected life (years) 6 6 6 Risk-free interest rate 3.95 % 1.97 % 1.44 % Fair value of options granted $ 98.66 $ 63.00 $ 49.42 Dividend yield is the average of historical yields and those estimated over the average expected life. The stock volatility is based on historical volatilities of our common stock. The average expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate with stripped coupon interest for the period equal to the contractual term of the share option grant in effect at the time of grant. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 0.5 million, $ 6.9 million and $ 37.2 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. Total compensation cost not yet recognized for nonvested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 4.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.9 years. Cash proceeds from stock options exercised and tax benefits related to stock options exercised were $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million for 123 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted common stock awards. The following table summarizes activity in performance unit awards as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023: Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Nonvested, beginning of period 224,548 $ 140.44 Granted 79,396 288.28 Vested ( 73,060 ) 102.29 Forfeited ( 7,028 ) 229.70 Nonvested, end of period 223,856 207.61 The weighted average grant date fair value of performance unit awards granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 22.9 million, $ 13.1 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively. For all periods presented, half of the performance unit awards granted were based on the targeted return on invested capital (“ROIC Award”), while the other half were granted based on targeted market conditions (“TSR Award”). The fair value of each TSR Award was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model as these equity awards are tied to a service and market condition. The calculation used the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Volatility 50.41 % 51.51 % 47.13 % Risk-free interest rate 4.51 % 1.72 % 0.27 % The weighted average fair value of performance unit awards that vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 17.2 million, $ 11.9 million and $ 5.8 million, respectively, based on the closing prices of our common stock on the dates of vesting. Total compensation cost not yet recognized for nonvested performance unit awards outstanding as of December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 24.8 million, calculated based on current expectation of specific performance criteria, and is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years. Each performance unit represents one share of common stock. The following table summarizes activity in non-performance based restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023: Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Nonvested, beginning of period 300,953 $ 120.09 Granted 87,240 221.86 Vested ( 183,258 ) 86.15 Forfeited ( 6,788 ) 196.00 Nonvested, end of period 198,147 190.40 The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 19.4 million, $ 15.4 million and $ 10.6 million, respectively. The weighted average fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 38.8 million, $ 17.8 million and $ 11.0 million, respectively, based on the closing prices of our common stock on the dates of vesting. Total compensation cost not yet recognized for nonvested, non-performance based restricted stock and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 20.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The fair value of the non-performance based restricted stock and restricted stock units was estimated on the date of grant adjusted for a dividend factor, if necessary. 124 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 20— Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income: The components and activity in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (net of deferred income taxes) consisted of the following during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Foreign Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedge (a) Cash Flow Hedge (b) Interest Rate Swap (c) Total Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 369,152 ) $ 46,593 $ 6,449 $ ( 10,022 ) $ ( 326,132 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 74,478 ) 5,110 174 — ( 69,194 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 93 — — 2,623 2,716 Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax ( 74,385 ) 5,110 174 2,623 ( 66,478 ) Amounts reclassified within accumulated other comprehensive income 51,703 ( 51,703 ) — — — Other comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests 160 — — — 160 Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 391,674 ) $ — $ 6,623 $ ( 7,399 ) $ ( 392,450 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 171,367 ) — ( 4,399 ) — ( 175,766 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 72 — — 7,399 7,471 Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax ( 171,295 ) — ( 4,399 ) 7,399 ( 168,295 ) Other comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 83 — — — 83 Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 562,886 ) $ — $ 2,224 $ — $ ( 560,662 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 26,337 — 5,986 — 32,323 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 66 — ( 135 ) — ( 69 ) Other comprehensive income, net of tax 26,403 — 5,851 — 32,254 Other comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 118 ) — — — ( 118 ) Balance at December 31, 2023 $ ( 536,601 ) $ — $ 8,075 $ — $ ( 528,526 ) (a) During the first quarter of 2021, the net investment hedge was discontinued following the repayment of the 1.875 % Euro-denominated senior notes. The balance of foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses associated with this discontinued net investment hedge have been reclassified to Foreign currency translation and other, and will remain within Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated. (b) We entered into a foreign currency forward contract in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . See Note 22, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” for additional information. (c) The pre-tax portion of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss is included in interest expense. The balance of this interest rate swap was being amortized to Interest and financing expenses over the life of the 4.15 % senior notes originally due in 2024. As discussed in Note 14, “Long-term Debt,” the Company repaid these notes in the second quarter of 2022, and as a result, reclassified the remaining balance of this interest rate swap to interest expense during the same period as part of the early extinguishment of debt. 125 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The amount of income tax benefit (expense) allocated to each component of Other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is provided in the following tables (in thousands): Foreign Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedge Cash Flow Hedge Interest Rate Swap Total 2023 Other comprehensive income, before tax $ 23,964 $ — $ 8,358 $ — $ 32,322 Income tax expense 2,439 — ( 2,507 ) — ( 68 ) Other comprehensive income, net of tax $ 26,403 $ — $ 5,851 $ — $ 32,254 2022 Other comprehensive (loss) income, before tax $ ( 168,953 ) $ — $ ( 4,399 ) $ 9,739 $ ( 163,613 ) Income tax expense ( 2,342 ) — — ( 2,340 ) ( 4,682 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax $ ( 171,295 ) $ — $ ( 4,399 ) $ 7,399 $ ( 168,295 ) 2021 Other comprehensive (loss) income, before tax $ ( 76,544 ) $ 6,552 $ 174 $ 3,336 $ ( 66,482 ) Income tax benefit (expense) 2,159 ( 1,442 ) — ( 713 ) 4 Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax $ ( 74,385 ) $ 5,110 $ 174 $ 2,623 $ ( 66,478 ) NOTE 21— Income Taxes: Income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments, and current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) are composed of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments: Domestic $ ( 461,897 ) $ 952,799 $ ( 186,077 ) Foreign 708,635 1,480,645 319,695 Total $ 246,738 $ 2,433,444 $ 133,618 Current income tax expense (benefit): Federal $ ( 54,250 ) $ 33,230 $ 11,722 State ( 3,395 ) 4,965 694 Foreign 387,045 259,054 55,530 Total $ 329,400 $ 297,249 $ 67,946 Deferred income tax expense (benefit): Federal $ ( 8,545 ) $ 84,054 $ ( 38,413 ) State ( 4,154 ) ( 3,511 ) ( 5,544 ) Foreign 113,576 12,796 5,457 Total $ 100,877 $ 93,339 $ ( 38,500 ) Total income tax expense $ 430,277 $ 390,588 $ 29,446 126 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: % of Income Before Income Taxes 2023 2022 2021 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State taxes, net of federal tax benefit ( 2.8 ) — ( 3.5 ) Change in valuation allowance (a) 98.8 ( 3.9 ) 33.7 Impact of foreign earnings, net (b)(c) 7.7 ( 0.1 ) ( 40.5 ) Global intangible low tax inclusion 4.2 0.3 12.3 Foreign-derived intangible income — ( 3.0 ) — Section 162(m) limitation 4.4 0.3 4.5 Subpart F income ( 1.9 ) 0.2 4.8 Stock-based compensation ( 3.9 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 7.2 ) Depletion ( 2.4 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 2.9 ) U.S. federal return to provision ( 6.1 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 1.7 ) Revaluation of unrecognized tax benefits/reserve requirements (d) 39.1 2.3 3.0 Legal accrual (e) 18.6 — — Other items, net ( 2.3 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 1.5 ) Effective income tax rate 174.4 % 16.1 % 22.0 % (a) Due to the Company being in a three-year cumulative loss position in China as of December 31, 2023, the year ended December 31, 2023 includes the establishment of a valuation allowance of $ 223.0 million on current year losses in one of our Chinese entities. The years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include benefits of $ 91.8 million and $ 6.0 million, respectively, due to the release of a foreign valuation allowance due to changes in expected profitability. (b) The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a discrete tax benefit of $ 27.9 million related to the revision of an indemnification estimate for an ongoing tax-related matter in Germany. (c) Our statutory rate is decreased by our share of the income of JBC, a Free Zones company under the laws of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The applicable provisions of the Jordanian law, and applicable regulations thereunder, do not have a termination provision and the exemption is indefinite. As a Free Zones company, JBC is not subject to income taxes on the profits of products exported from Jordan, and currently, substantially all of the profits are from exports. This resulted in a rate benefit of 20.1 %, 3.2 %, and 34.6 % for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. (d) The year ended December 31, 2023 includes a $ 96.5 million expense recorded for a current year tax reserve related to an uncertain tax position in Chile.

See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for further details on this matter. 127 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred income tax assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Accrued employee benefits $ 31,917 $ 20,060 Operating loss carryovers 1,316,916 1,157,841 Pensions 23,527 26,229 Inventory reserves 83,136 3,600 Tax credit carryovers 1,431 3,750 Other (a) 103,517 118,733 Gross deferred tax assets 1,560,444 1,330,213 Valuation allowance ( 1,349,924 ) ( 1,087,505 ) Deferred tax assets 210,520 242,708 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation ( 541,245 ) ( 446,942 ) Intangibles ( 54,413 ) ( 84,690 ) Other ( 150,859 ) ( 145,412 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 746,517 ) ( 677,044 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 535,997 ) $ ( 434,336 ) Classification in the consolidated balance sheets: Noncurrent deferred tax assets $ 22,433 $ 46,434 Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( 558,430 ) ( 480,770 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 535,997 ) $ ( 434,336 ) Changes in the balance of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance are as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Balance at January 1 $ ( 1,087,505 ) $ ( 1,276,305 ) $ ( 1,326,204 ) Additions ( 262,469 ) ( 5,810 ) ( 61,470 ) Deductions 50 194,610 111,369 Balance at December 31 $ ( 1,349,924 ) $ ( 1,087,505 ) $ ( 1,276,305 ) At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $ 1.4 million of domestic credits available to offset future payments of income taxes, expiring in varying amounts between 2024 and 2028. We have established valuation allowances for $ 0.1 million of those domestic credits since we believe that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated during the carryover period in order to utilize the other remaining credit carryovers. At December 31, 2023, we have on a pre-tax basis, domestic state net operating losses of $ 355.5 million, expiring between 2022 and 2041, which have pre-tax valuation allowances of $ 13.8 million established. In addition, we have on a pre-tax basis $ 5.2 billion of foreign net operating losses, which have pre-tax valuation allowances for $ 5.1 billion established. $ 643.5 million of these foreign net operating losses expire in 2028, $ 2.7 billion expire in 2035, $ 215.1 million expire in 2036. $ 19.7 million expire in 2037, $ 14.3 million expire at various other dates and $ 1.6 billion have an indefinite life. We have established valuation allowances for these deferred tax assets since we believe that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the same reason, we established pre-tax valuation allowances of $ 250.9 million and $ 265.5 million for other state and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, unrelated to net operating losses. The realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. However, the amount considered realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income change. As of December 31, 2023, we have not recorded taxes on approximately $ 11.1 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint ventures. The TCJA imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign 128 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS earnings and generally eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution with the exception of foreign withholding taxes and other foreign local tax. We generally do not provide for taxes related to our undistributed earnings because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If in the foreseeable future, we can no longer demonstrate that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability will be recognized. A determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary based on the manner in which the undistributed earnings would be repatriated. Liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $ 220.6 million and $ 83.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, inclusive of interest and penalties of $ 42.0 million and $ 11.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported in Other noncurrent liabilities as provided in Note 16, “Other Noncurrent Liabilities.” These liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were reduced by $ 73.0 million and $ 32.4 million, respectively, for offsetting benefits from the corresponding effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state and local income taxes, and rate arbitrage related to foreign structure. These offsetting benefits are recorded in Other assets as provided in Note 11, “Other Assets.” The resulting net liability of $ 105.6 million as of December 31, 2023 would favorably affect earnings if recognized and released, while the net liability of $ 39.8 million at December 31, 2022 would favorably affect earnings if recognized and released. The liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, exclusive of interest, were $ 178.8 million and $ 72.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following is a reconciliation of our total gross liability related to uncertain tax positions for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Balance at January 1 $ 72,162 $ 20,717 $ 11,639 Additions for tax positions related to prior years 6,216 1,673 75 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years — — ( 6 ) Additions for tax positions related to current year 101,179 50,531 10,911 Lapses in statutes of limitations/settlements ( 770 ) ( 995 ) ( 1,931 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 2 ) 236 29 Balance at December 31 $ 178,785 $ 72,162 $ 20,717 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to the statute of limitations, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for years prior to 2020. Due to the statute of limitations, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state income tax audits prior to 2017. With respect to jurisdictions outside the U.S., several audits are in process. We have audits ongoing for the years 2014 through 2022 related to Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Germany and South Africa, some of which are for entities that have since been divested. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Since the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits is uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months. Our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record an increase in the liability related to uncertain tax positions, relating to a number of issues, up to approximately $ 0.4 million as a result of closure of tax statutes. NOTE 22— Fair Value of Financial Instruments: In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, we use methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and other risk factors existing at the time of assessment. Fair value information for our financial instruments is as follows: Long-Term Debt—the fair values of our notes are estimated using Level 1 inputs and account for the difference between the recorded amount and fair value of our long-term debt. The carrying value of our remaining long-term debt reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value as substantially all of such debt bears interest based on prevailing variable market rates currently available in the countries in which we have borrowings. 129 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2023 2022 Recorded Amount Fair Value Recorded Amount Fair Value (In thousands) Long-term debt $ 4,186,532 $ 4,021,693 $ 3,239,853 $ 2,993,027 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts—during the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of non-functional currency purchases during the construction of the Kemerton plant in Australia. This derivative financial instrument is used to manage risk and is not used for trading or other speculative purposes. This foreign currency forward contract has been designated as a hedging instrument under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding designated foreign currency forward contracts with notional values totaling the equivalent of $ 994.5 million and $ 64.5 million, respectively. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts in connection with our risk management strategies that have not been designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , in an attempt to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. The fair values of our non-designated foreign currency forward contracts are estimated based on current settlement values. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding non-designated foreign currency forward contracts with notional values totaling $ 7.1 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively, hedging our exposure to various currencies including the Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Australian Dollar, Chilean Peso and Japanese Yen.

In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded net cash receipts (settlements) of $ 218.0 million, ($ 44.4 ) million and ($ 2.4 ) million, respectively, primarily within Changes in current assets and liabilities, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 130 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unrealized gains and losses related to the cash flow hedges will be reclassified to earnings over the life of the related assets when settled and the related assets are placed into service. The counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. NOTE 23— Fair Value Measurement: Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability We endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following tables set forth our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): December 31, 2023 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Items (Level 1) Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Similar Items (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Available for sale debt securities (a) $ 289,307 $ — $ — $ 289,307 Investments under executive deferred compensation plan (b) $ 33,564 $ 33,564 $ — $ — Public equity securities (c) $ 168,928 $ 168,928 $ — $ — Private equity securities measured at net asset value (d)(e) $ 4,536 $ — $ — $ — Foreign currency forward contracts (f) $ 17,829 $ — $ 17,829 $ — Liabilities: Obligations under executive deferred compensation plan (b) $ 33,564 $ 33,564 $ — $ — Foreign currency forward contracts (f) $ 5,752 $ — $ 5,752 $ — December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Items (Level 1) Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Similar Items (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Available for sale debt securities (a) $ 260,139 $ — $ — $ 260,139 Investments under executive deferred compensation plan (b) $ 27,270 $ 27,270 $ — $ — Public equity securities (c) $ 5,890 $ 5,890 $ — $ — Private equity securities measured at net asset value (d)(e) $ 6,375 $ — $ — $ — Foreign currency forward contracts (f) $ 6,016 $ — $ 6,016 $ — Liabilities: Obligations under executive deferred compensation plan (b) $ 27,270 $ 27,270 $ — $ — Foreign currency forward contracts (f) $ 3,244 $ — $ 3,244 $ — (a) Preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary acquired as a portion of the proceeds of the FCS sale on June 1, 2021. See Note 3, “Divestitures,” for further details on the material terms and conditions. A third-party estimate of the fair value was prepared using expected future cash flows over the period up to when the asset is likely to be redeemed, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant's view of the risk associated with the investment. These are considered to be Level 3 inputs. 131 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (b) We maintain an EDCP that was adopted in 2001 and subsequently amended. The purpose of the EDCP is to provide current tax planning opportunities as well as supplemental funds upon the retirement or death of certain of our employees. The EDCP is intended to aid in attracting and retaining employees of exceptional ability by providing them with these benefits. We also maintain a Benefit Protection Trust (the “Trust”) that was created to provide a source of funds to assist in meeting the obligations of the EDCP, subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency. Assets of the Trust are consolidated in accordance with authoritative guidance. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of mutual fund investments (which are accounted for as trading securities and are marked-to-market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statements of income) and cash and cash equivalents. As such, these assets and obligations are classified within Level 1. (c) Holdings in equity securities of public companies reported in Investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value is measured using publicly available share prices of the investments, with any changes reported in Other income (expenses), net, in our consolidated statements of income. See Note 10, “Investments,” for further details. (d) Primarily consists of private equity securities reported in Investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The changes in fair value are reported in Other income (expenses), net in our consolidated statements of income. (e) Holdings in certain private equity securities are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. (f) As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, we minimize our risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. The foreign currency forward contracts are valued using broker quotations or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2. See Note 22, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” for further details about our foreign currency forward contracts. The following tables set forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for the Level 3 recurring fair value measurements (in thousands): Available for Sale Debt Securities Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Beginning balance $ 260,139 $ 246,517 Accretion of discount 5,306 12,735 PIK dividends 19,307 — Change in fair value 4,554 887 Ending balance $ 289,306 $ 260,139 NOTE 24— Related Party Transactions: Our consolidated statements of income include sales to and purchases from unconsolidated affiliates in the ordinary course of business as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Sales to unconsolidated affiliates $ 35,676 $ 51,906 $ 19,441 Purchases from unconsolidated affiliates (a) $ 3,652,784 $ 1,920,476 $ 213,077 (a) Purchases from unconsolidated affiliates primarily relate to spodumene purchased from the Company’s Windfield joint venture.

In addition, the Company announced its decision to retain its Catalysts business under a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary renamed Ketjen. As a result, the Company’s three reportable segments include: (1) Energy Storage; (2) Specialties; and (3) Ketjen. Each segment has a dedicated team of sales, research and development, process engineering, manufacturing and sourcing, and business strategy personnel and has full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus, agility and responsiveness. This business structure aligns with the markets and customers we serve through each of the segments. This structure also facilitates the continued standardization of business processes across the organization, and is consistent with the manner in which information is presently used internally by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. The segment information for the prior year periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables. The “All Other” category included only the FCS business that did not fit into any of the Company’s core businesses. On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the FCS business. See Note 3, “Divestitures,” for additional information. Amounts in the “All Other” category represent activity in this business until divested on June 1, 2021. The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the operating segments. Pension and other post-employment benefit (“OPEB”) service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit (“Non-operating pension and OPEB items”) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes inter-segment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs. The Company’s chief operating decision maker uses adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to assess the ongoing performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expenses, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis. These non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration related costs, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, certain litigation and arbitration costs and charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business and enterprise planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. The Company has reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides additional useful measurements to review the Company’s operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Total adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Total adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment information for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands). Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the current segment structure. 133 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net sales: Energy Storage $ 7,078,998 $ 4,660,945 $ 1,067,430 Specialties 1,482,425 1,759,587 1,424,197 Ketjen 1,055,780 899,572 761,235 Total segment net sales 9,617,203 7,320,104 3,252,862 All Other — — 75,095 Total net sales $ 9,617,203 $ 7,320,104 $ 3,327,957 Adjusted EBITDA: Energy Storage $ 2,407,393 $ 3,032,260 $ 371,384 Specialties 298,506 527,318 468,836 Ketjen 103,872 28,732 106,941 Total segment adjusted EBITDA 2,809,771 3,588,310 947,161 See below for a reconciliation of total segment adjusted EBITDA to the companies consolidated Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Total segment adjusted EBITDA $ 2,809,771 $ 3,588,310 $ 947,161 All other adjusted EBITDA — — 29,858 Corporate expenses, net ( 43,486 ) ( 112,453 ) ( 106,045 ) Depreciation and amortization ( 429,944 ) ( 300,841 ) ( 254,000 ) Interest and financing expenses (a) ( 116,072 ) ( 122,973 ) ( 61,476 ) Income tax expense ( 430,277 ) ( 390,588 ) ( 29,446 ) Gain (loss) on change in interest in properties/sale of business, net (b) 71,190 ( 8,400 ) 295,971 Acquisition and integration related costs (c) ( 26,767 ) ( 16,259 ) ( 12,670 ) Goodwill impairment (d) ( 6,765 ) — — Non-operating pension and OPEB items 7,971 57,032 78,814 Mark-to-market (loss) gain on public equity securities (e) ( 44,732 ) 4,319 — Legal accrual (f) ( 218,510 ) — ( 657,412 ) Albemarle Foundation contribution (g) — — ( 20,000 ) Indemnification adjustments (h) — — ( 39,381 ) Other (i) 1,097 ( 8,331 ) ( 47,702 ) Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation $ 1,573,476 $ 2,689,816 $ 123,672 (a) Included in Interest and financing expenses is a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 19.2 million and $ 29.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The corresponding obligation was initially recorded in Accrued liabilities prior to being transferred to MRL, which held a 40 % ownership interest in these Kemerton assets during those periods. See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” for additional information. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2021, includes a $ 428.4 million gain related to the FCS divestiture.

MESSAGE OF THE CEO OF THE COMPANY\nDear shareholders, c ustomers , communities, collaborators and stakeholders in general, I would \nlike to present SQM ’s 2023 Annual Report, year on which we have achieved several of our Company \ngoals, such as, for example, record sales volumes for our lithium business and record in iodine \nproduction, which meant that in terms of income, 2023 is the second best year in SQM's history.  \n \nIn the iodine segment, we successfully started operations in Pampa Blanca, which brought with it greater \nproduction to be available on the market. We also began the construction of the seawater pipeline, a \nproject that will bring higher returns and is in l ine with our sustainability objectives in terms of our \naspirations to reduce continental water consumption in our operations.  \n \nIn the fertilizer business, significantly lower prices were observed than in 2022, however, in the \nPotassium segment this was compensated by higher sales volumes and in Specialty Plant Nutrition we \nobserved a recovery in demand towards the end of the year,  which which makes us start 2024 with a \nmore optimistic vision for the rest of the year.  \n \nIn lithium, we continue working on capacity expansion projects in both lithium carbonate and lithium \nhydroxide at our Lithium Chemical Plant in Chile. Also, we began producing lithium hydroxide from \nlithium sulfate - an absolute innovation by our team of professionals - at our refining plant in China and, \ntowards the end  of the year, our mining and concentrator facilities at our Mt. Holland project. , in \nAustralia, began operations. The year 2023 was also a year to increase our presence in Australia, where \nat the beginning of the year we acquired a portion of Azure Minera ls and at the end of the year, we \nannounced together with Hancock Prospecting our intention to jointly acquire the rest of the company. \nThis will allow us to diversify and expand our lithium production to supply the market in this growing \nindustry, contrib uting with our participation towards the transition that the world is experiencing towards \nelectromobility and helping to decarbonize the planet.  \n \nOur commitment to sustainability is in our priorities and this is how in September 2023, our lithium \nmining operations in the Salar de Atacama reached IRMA 75, the first and only lithium producer in the \nworld to achieve this score. The ranking reflects our  commitment to producing the most sustainable \nlithium in the world in the Salar de Atacama. And not only that, in 2023 we completed several \ncertifications within the ISO Standards (International Organization for Standardization) and were \naccepted in the Do w Jones Sustainability Index World and Emerging Markets indices, two years ahead \nof our internal goal. In relation to our contribution to the development of the towns in the regions where \nwe operate, I would like to highlight the joint work of our teams de ployed in the north of our country \nwho, together with the communities, have managed to carry out interesting projects that are a \ncontribution to development. social and community development of the region, among them I highlight \nthe Atacama Tierra Fértil p rogram, giving a boost to local agriculture and demonstrating that, using \ncertain horticulture and water use techniques, agriculture can be developed in desert lands. Another \nsuccessful program has been the continuation of the Alianza Mujer Atacameña (AMA)  program, to \nstrengthen the role of Lickanantay women and promote the labor development of entrepreneurial women \nin the towns surrounding our Salar de Atacama site.  \nFor its part, in Tarapacá two Shared Social Value projects promoted by SQM were recognized by \nConecta  2023, of the United Nations Global Compact. The Alfalfa Productive Center in the People \ncategory, and the Pozo Almonte de la Tirana Agricultural Research and Development Center, recognized \nin SDG Interconnection and Alliances.  \n \nAll of this, among other milestones related to the sustainability of our operations, can be reviewed in \ngreater detail in our soon -to-be-published 2023 Sustainability Report and Social Report.   \n \n5 \nMESSAGE OF THE CEO OF THE COMPANY     \nAnother important activity that kept us busy throughout the year were the negotiations we had with the \nNational Copper Corporation (Codelco), under the announced National Lithium Strategy, to be able to \nextend our operation beyond the expiration date of th e lease contract. from the Salar de Atacama to Corfo \non December 31, 2030. Thus, at the end of the year we announced the signing of a non -binding \nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Codelco for the joint operation and development of the \nSalar de Atacama  during the period 2025 to 2060 .  \n \nFinally, I would like to thank our employees and stakeholders for their support, since each of them, in \ntheir own capacity, contributes towards SQM's efforts to improve people's quality of life by providing \nsolutions for human progress .  \n \nWith my warmest  rewards , \n \nRicardo Ramos Rodríguez  \nChief  Executive Officer  \n \nSQM IN NUMBERS  \n \nSQM is a global chemical company that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Santiago \nStock Exchange (NYSE: SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM -B, SQM -A).

All these  shares are registered, have no par value , and are issued, subscribed \nand paid. Article 5 of the Company's By -laws establishes that Series B shares have a restricted right to \nvote as they can only elect one Director of the Company, regardless of their capital stock’s share , and \nhave the right to :  \n(a) call for an Ordinary or Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting when the shareholders of at least \n5% of the Series B shares request so; and \n(b) call for an Extraordinary Board of Directors Meeting without the Chairman’s authorization \nwhen it is requested by the Director elected by the shareholders of the Series B shares.  \nThe limitation and preferences of the Series B shares have a duration of 50 consecutive and continuous \nyears starting as of June 3, 1993.  \nSeries A shares have the option to exclude the Director elected by Series B shareholders from the voting \nprocess in which the Chairman of the Board is to be elected, if there is a tie in the first voting process. \nThe limitation and preferences of the Serie s A shares have a duration of 50 consecutive and continuous \nyears starting as of June 3, 1993.  \nThe second transitory article and articles 31 and 31 bis of the Company’s By -laws establish that in \nGeneral Shareholders’ Meetings each shareholder will have a right to one vote for each share he owns \nor represents and (a) that no shareholder will have the  right to vote for himself or on behalf of other \nshareholders of the same Series A or Series B shares representing more than 37.5% of the total \noutstanding shares with right to vote of each Series and (b) that no shareholder will have the right to vote \nfor himself or on behalf of other shareholders representing more than 32% of the total outstanding shares \nwith a right to vote. In calculating a single shareholder’s ownership of Series A or B shares, the \nshareholder’s stock and those pertaining to third part ies related to them are to be added.  \nThe second transitory article provides as follows:  \n“Throughout the period running from the date of the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting at which this \ntransitory article is incorporated, and December 31, 2030, the restriction against voting on behalf of more \nthan 37.5% of any series of shares in the Comp any, established in Article 31 hereof, shall be subject to \nthe following exception, applicable only to the election of board members by means of Series A shares \nin the Company: If two or more persons, regardless of whether or not they are related parties t o each \nother (the incoming shareholders), act prior to December 31, 2030 such as to acquire a sufficient number \nof Series A shares to allow them to hold voting powers for the selection of directors of the Company \namounting to more than 37.5% of that series , then any registered shareholder or group of shareholders \nholding more than 37.5% of all Series A shares in the Company shall be entitled to vote for the selection \nof directors of the Company amounting to whichever is less, between a number of the Series A shares \nthat are held (i) by existing shareholders as of that date, and (ii) by the incoming shareholders with voting \nrights.  \n  \n \n \n2      COMPANY PROFILE    14 Similarly, if for any reason a registered shareholder in the Company as of the date hereof who holds \nmore than 37.5% of Series A shares in the company between the date hereof and December 31, 2030, \ncomes to hold more voting shares for the selection of dire ctors of the Company than the votes allocated \nfor holding 37.5% of said Series A shares, either through a joint action agreement with other \nshareholders, including existing shareholders, or by any other means, then any other shareholder or group \nof shareho lders in the Company that is not a related party to the same and holds more than 37.5% of all \nvoting Series A shares in the Company, including both existing and incoming shareholders, shall be \nentitled to vote for the selection of directors of the Company in accordance with whichever number of \nSeries A shares in the Company is the lesser, between (i) the number held by this shareholder or group \nof shareholders, and (ii) the existing shareholder may have the capacity to vote in excess of the restriction \namou nting to 37.5% of said shares.”  \nArticle 5 bis of the Company's By -laws establishes that no person can directly or through third parties, \nstate owned companies, decentralized, autonomous, municipal or other institutions, hold more than 32% \nof the Company’s total shares with right  to vote.  \nEach Series A share and Series B share is entitled to share equally in the Company’s profits, i.e., they \nhave the same rights on any dividends declared on the outstanding shares of SQM.  \n \nThe Company By -laws do not contain any provision relating to (a) redemption provisions (b) sinking \nfunds or (c) liability to capital calls by the Company.  \n \nAs established in article 103 of Law No. 18,046, a company subject to the supervision of the SVS may be \nliquidated in the following cases:  \n \n• Expiration of the duration term, if any, as established in its By -laws;  \n• All the shares end up in the possession of one individual for more than ten continuous days;  \n• By agreement of an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting;  \n• By abolition, pursuant to applicable laws, of the decree that authorized its existence;  \n• Any other reason contemplated in its By -laws.  \n \nArticle 40 of the Company’s By -laws states that in the event of liquidation, the Shareholders’ Meeting will \nappoint a three -member receiver committee that will have the authority to carry out the liquidation process. \nAny surplus will be distributed equally  among the shareholders.  \n  \nThe only way to change the rights of the holders of the SQM shares, including holders of our ADSs, is by \nmodifying its By -laws, which can only be carried out by an Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting, as  \nestablished in article 28 of the Company By -laws.   \n \n \n2      COMPANY PROFILE    15 \nDividend Policy  \nDividends are annually distributed to the Series A and Series B shareholders of record on the fifth \nbusiness day prior to the date for payment of the dividends. The By -laws do not specify a time limit after \nwhich dividend entitlement elapses but Chilean re gulations establish that after 5 years, unclaimed \ndividends are to be donated to the Chilean Fire Department.  \n \nSQM’s dividend policy for 202 3, reported at the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting held on April  \n6, 202 3, included the follo wing:  \n \na) distribute and pay, as a final dividend ( dividendo definitivo ) to the corresponding shareholders, \na percentage of the net income that shall be determined per the following financial parameters:  \n \nDividend Payment (% of the 202 3 Net Income)   \n100%   \n80%  \n60% \n“Total Current Assets” / “Total Financial Liabilities”  ≥ 2.5  \n2.0  \n1.5 \n\"Total current and non/current liabilities −Cas h and cash equivalents \n−Other current financial assets \"/ “Total equity ” ≤ 0.8  \n0.9  \n1.0 \nIf none of the foregoing financial parameters are met, the Company shall distribute and pay, as a final dividend, \nand in favor of the respective shareholders, 50% of the 202 3 net income.  \n \n \nb) The amount  of provisional dividends may be higher or lower, depending on whether, according \nto the information available to the Company's board of directors on the date on which their \ndistribution is agreed, it does not materially and negatively affect the capacity of the Company. \nCompany to make its investments, comply with its obligations, and in general, comply with the \ninvestment and financing policy approved by the general shareholders meeting  \n \nc) For the ordinary meeting held during fiscal year 2024, the Company's board of directors will \npropose a final dividend according to the corresponding percentage according to the financial \nparameters expressed in letter (a) above, discounting the amount of t he provisional dividends \npreviously distributed during fiscal year 2023.  \n \nd) If there is a remaining balance of the liquid profits of the commercial year of 2023, it may be \nretained and used to finance its own operations, or to one or more of the Company's investment \nprojects, without prejudice to a possible distribution of eventua l dividends charged to \naccumulated profits approved by the shareholders' meeting, or the possible and future \ncapitalization of all or part of it  \n \ne) The payment of additional dividends ( dividendos adicionales ) is not considered .  \n \nIt is expressly stated that the aforementioned dividend policy corresponds to the intention of the \nCompany's board of directors, so its compliance will be conditional on the profits that are obtained, as \nwell as the results indicated by the projections tha t may be periodically made by the Company, or to the \nexistence of certain conditions, as applicable. In any case, if the dividend policy set forth by the \nCompany's board of directors undergoes any substantial change, the Company must communicate it as \nan essential fact.   \n \n \n2      COMPANY PROFILE    16 The proposed dividend policy for 2024 is expected to be announced at the Shareholders' Meeting to be \nheld on April 25, 2024.  \nStatistical information: dividends  \nAll series A and series B shares carry equal rights to share in any dividend declared on SQM’s \nshareholder capital in circulation.

OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n3.1 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  \n \nSQM has a Corporate Governance Model based on the Corporate Governance Policy, which is the \nreference framework for directors, applying its last update in October 2022. The corporate governance \npolicy is available on the SQM website  of the Company , in the Investors section, then Sustainability - \nCorporate governance - documents and policies, or at the following link:  \nhttps://s25.q4cdn.com/757756353/files/governance_doc/2022/11/Corporate -Governance -\nPolicy_eng_Oct2022.pdf   \n \nThe corporate governance policy is available to be voted on by shareholders each year before the first \nnotice to the ordinary shareholders' meeting on our website. This policy establishes the duty of the board \nof directors to exercise its best judgment in accordance with what it reasonably believes represents the \ninterest of the Company and its shareh olders. In this way, it is a guide to guide the responsible exercise \nof the functions of the directors, without constituting legal obligations, since they are assumed to be \nknown.  \n \nAnnually the Board, or a committee of the Board, will review its corporate governance policy. As part \nof this process, the Board will review corporate governance best practices adopted by other entities, both \nlocally and internationally.  \n \nFurthermore, in line with best practices worldwide, SQM's Sustainability, Ethics and Human Rights \nPolicy (available on our website : \nhttps://s25.q4cdn.com/757756353/files/governance_doc/2021/Sustainability -Ethics -and-Human -\nRights -Policy.pdf   and the commitments that emanate from it, reflect the company's comprehensive \napproach to sustainability. Progress in relation to these good governance, environmental and social \ncommitments is led and supervised by the board of directors and involves worke rs, including contractors; \nshareholders, the supplier and supply chain, customers, as well as the communities and territories where \noperations are located. The data regarding the 2023 management in the areas of sustainability are \nreported in Section 8.2 of this Report . \n \nActing ethically begins with the basic commitment of each SQM member to the law and the company's \nvalues: Excellence, Integrity, Safety and Sustainability. In this context, the Code of Ethics and the Code \nof Conduct for Business Partners are essential docu ments for the management of these matters and are \nsupported by related policies, procedures and financial controls, which - together - are a relevant \ncomponent of the Ethics Program. and Compliance of the company. These regulatory instruments and \nthe progr am apply to all members of the organization: senior executives, board members, managers, full -\ntime and part -time workers, in all operations, whether local or international.  \n \nAmong those regulatory instruments that make up the company's ethical action framework are also the \nConflict of Interest Policy, which aims to protect the integrity of the company's decision -making process; \nthe Free Competition Policy, which establishes ru les around conduct that should never be carried out in \nthe context of the market, in order to avoid anti -competitive practices; and the Crime Prevention Model \n(the “ CPM ”), which complies with the provisions established in Law 20,393, on Criminal Liability of \nLegal Entities, and its modifications.

This plan should consider the information and \nevaluation provided by the different areas involved in risk management, monitoring of the \nactivities carried out by these areas, updating of the risk identificatio n and evaluation, and \ntraining or dissemination activities.  \n \n• To facilitate risk management training, mainly for areas that manage critical processes.  \n \n• To ensure the efficient application of the risk management methodology, adhering to the \norganization's policies, standards, manuals, and procedures.  \n \n• To facilitate and coordinate the identification, evaluation, treatment, and follow -up of critical \nrisks with the business areas.  \n \n• To provide methodological support to the different areas involved in risk management, regarding \nthe implementation of the risk management policy and procedure.  \n \n• To monitor that the corresponding responsible parties adequately implement the action plans for \ncritical risks.  \n \n• To periodically report to the Directors/Audit and Financial Risk Committee. This report shall \ncontain, at a minimum, the management activities performed (including identification, \nevaluation, and action plans) with regard to the risks and critical processe s. \n \nThere is also an Internal Audit area, where the scope of activities includes, but is not limited to, objective \nexaminations of evidence for the purpose of providing independent assessments to the Directors/Audit \nand Financial Risk Committee and senior mana gement on the adequacy and effectiveness of the \nCompany's processes, risk management, and controls.  \n \nThe audits performed by the Internal Audit area include verifying whether:  \n \n• The actions of the Company's directors, officers, employees, and contractors comply with the \nCompany's policies, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations.  \n  \n3      OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     40 • The processes and systems in place enable control and compliance with policies, procedures, \nlaws, and regulations that could significantly affect the Company.  \n \n• The information and the means used to identify, measure, analyze, classify, and report such \ninformation are reliable and of high integrity.  \n \n• Resources and assets are acquired cost -effectively, used efficiently, and adequately protected.  \n \nInternal Audit also provides the following services:  \n \n• Risk management and control consulting, as required by senior management and not affecting \nthe objectivity and independence of the function.  \n \n• To evaluate the design and effectiveness of internal controls for issuing financial statements, \nreporting the results to the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President of Finance, in order \nto comply with Section 302 of the Sarbanes -Oxley Act.  \n \nThe Audit and Risk Manager will report periodically to senior management and the Directors/Audit and \nFinancial Risk Committee, regarding:  \n \n• The purpose, authority, and responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Manager.  \n \n• The Audit Plan and its development.  \n \n• Internal Audit's compliance with the Standards, and action plans to address any significant \nbreaches.  \n \n• Significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, FCPA, governance issues, \nand other matters requiring the Committee's attention.  \n \n• Results of audit work or other activities.  \n \n• Resource requirements.  \n \n• Any risk that may be assumed by senior management that is unacceptable to the Company.  \n \nThe Audit and Risk Manager also coordinates activities, where possible, and may rely on the work of \nother internal and external assurance and consulting service providers as needed. The audits may identify \nopportunities to improve the efficiency of risk ma nagement processes and controls. These opportunities \nare communicated to the appropriate level of senior management, the Chief Executive Officer and the \nDirectors/Audit and Financial Risk Committee.  \nRisk Management Model  \n \nBased on the Corporate Policy on the matter, the company's Risk Management Model consists of a \nmethodology that establishes a process under the principles and guidelines of the ISO 31000 standard \nand COSO ERM (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway). , which determine a set of \ncoordinated activities to direct and control in a reasonable way the achievement of its objectives.  \n \nThe risk management process considers the following stages:   \n3      OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     41 a) Identification  \nb) Evaluation  \nc) Treatment  \nd) Monitoring  \ne) Communication  \n \nRisk assessment consists of determining two dimensions for each risk: the probability of occurrence and \nthe impact it would generate on the Company if the risk materializes.  \n \nThe risk assessment is carried out on the basis of the inherent risk, to document what the impact and \nprobability would be of not mediating with controls, or in the event that they do not operate satisfactorily, \nand then on the residual risk, that is, cons idering the measures of mitigation that the areas identify. \nProbability and impact are quantified from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest level. The impact can be:  \n \nNegligible, Minor, Moderate, High or Very high, while the probability can be: Unlikely, Unlikely, \nPossible, Probable or Almost Certainty. If an unwanted event could have more than one type of \nconsequence, the impact is determined by the highest consequence . \n \nOn the other hand, the level of risk is determined through the weighting between impact and probability. \nBeing a 5x5 matrix, there are 25 risk levels, which for simplicity are divided into 4 main categories: \nExtreme (red), Significant (orange), Medium (yel low) and Low (green). For the proper management of \neach risk, the Risk Owner(s) is defined.  \n \nIn addition to the risk assessment, the area identifies the Control Activities it has implemented for each \nrisk. This allows the risk management area, together with the Control Owner, to identify the specific \ncontrols for each risk.  \n \nOnce the evaluation is completed, and the subsequent identification of controls is completed, the risk \nmanagement area sends the risk matrix to each area for their management and control, including the \nidentified controls.  \n \nIndependent of this update, each area is responsible for keeping its matrix updated and managing the \ncorrect application of controls.

Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Company has procedures that ensure that the products it \nproduces and markets comply with current regulations in all the countries where it operates and with \nrespect to each of the areas d escribed in Section 6.1, Legal or Regulatory Framework. Also please ref er \nto Section 8.2 of this Report in the subsection Management of chemicals to protect safety and the \nenvironment, to see how we manage these risks. Also, please refer to Section 8.1 of this Report, Legal \nand Regulatory Compliance.  \n   \nHuman Rights Risk Management  \n \nIn order to comply with the Human Rights Due Diligence commitments undertaken by the company and \nreflected in its Sustainability, Ethics, and Human Rights Policy, SQM commissioned a Human Rights \nImpact Assessment (HRIA) from a specialized law firm. This fi rst HRIA followed the methodological \nstandard developed by the Danish Institute for Human Rights, coupled with the reporting criteria of the \nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) and based on the UN Principles on Business and Human Rights. The \npurpose of this survey was to identify, understand, evaluate, and take charge of any potential adverse \neffects of SQM's activities on the enjoyment of its main stakeholders' human rights (workers, \ncommunities surrounding the project, suppliers, etc.).  \n \nThis survey's baseline and findings were subsequently subject to an on -site participatory review process \nwith the principal stakeholders, carried out by a consultant, in order to corroborate and/or modify the  \n3      OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     45 initial findings and generate the controls, policies, and action and monitoring plans suitable for \nresponding to these challenges.  \n \nBased on the aforementioned inputs, SQM's Risk Management area proceeded to consolidate and unify \nthe information to generate the Participatory Matrix  that was in the Sustainability Committee of the \nsecond quarter of 2023.  \n \nIn the second half of 2023, a similar exercise was carried out at the Lithium Chemical Plant and the \nresults are expected to be available within the first half of 2024.  \n \nRole of the Board of Directors and Senior Management in Risk Management  \n \nThe Board of Directors oversees the supervision and development of the business risk management \nmodel through the Directors/Audit and Financial Risk Committee.  \n \nThe Vice -Presidencies are responsible for identifying, evaluating, quantifying, and communicating the \nrisks associated with their activity and the defined goals, as well as for defining controls and risk \ntreatment, each with defined responsibilities and de adlines, and for monitoring control and its principal \nrisks. These processes are conducted following the risk management procedure for the Business.  \n \nThe Business Risk Committee supervises, analyzes, and evaluates the development of the Risk \nManagement Model. This committee, together with the vice presidencies, defines the company's strategic \nrisks.  \n \nIn addition, the Sustainability Committee monitors the main commitments and risks related to: Water \nManagement, Emissions, Waste Management, Electric Power, and Communities. This committee is \nformed by the General Manager, the senior vice presidents and th ose responsible for the areas according \nto the topics discussed.  \n \nSuccession Plans  \n \nThe Company does not have a Succession Plan as such, but the Corporate Governance Policy defines \nthat it is the Board's responsibility to annually identify potential replacements for the Chief Executive \nOfficer and other senior executives of the Company, w ho possess the skills, knowledge, conditions, \nexperiences, and vision necessary for each position and to ensure that there is a plan to replace the Chief \nExecutive Officer and other senior executives in a timely manner, in the event of their unforeseen \nabsence, minimizing any possible impacts on the Company.  \n \nSalary Structure Review  \n \nSalary structures and compensation and indemnification policies for the CEO and other senior executives \nare not subject to shareholder approval or review by outside parties. It should be noted, however, that \nthe Board of Directors and its respective commit tees act in accordance with what is reasonably in the \nbest interest of the Company and its shareholders.  \n \nThe Corporate Governance Policy establishes that the Directors/Audit and Financial Risk Committee's \nresponsibilities include reviewing the compensation and remuneration plans of the chief executives, the \nChief Executive Officer and the company's employees,  as well as reviewing in detail the quarterly \nexpenses incurred by the Chief Executive Officer.  \n \n  \n3      OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     46 Code of Conduct and Whistleblower Channel  \n \nAs mentioned above, the company's Code of Ethics establishes the standards to be followed by all \nemployees in the performance of their duties. By complying with the Code, SQM ensures that work is \nbeing done in the right way with the right people and in a way that everyone can be proud of, creating \nvalue for all stakeholders.  \n \nThe Code is supported by policies, procedures, and related financial controls, which together are an \nimportant part of the Ethics and Compliance Program, based on a corporate culture of integrity and \nadherence to best practices.  \n \nViolations of the Code of Ethics are reported through the formal support and reporting channels that are \navailable to all SQM employees worldwide and also to third parties (shareholders, customers, suppliers, \nand business partners, among others). The corporate website and intranet have direct access to the \nwhistleblower channel for people to access and make their respective reports. The formal channels are:  \n \nwebsite: http://www.SQM.ethicspoint.com  \n \nIn addition to encouraging employees to access the corporate Whistleblower Channel, there is also the \npossibility for them to consult directly with the Ethics and Compliance Management on different matters \nrelated to the program.  \n \nAll reports of concerns are kept confidential in accordance with SQM policies and procedures. Reports \nmay also be made anonymously, where permitted by local law. Whistleblowers can know the status of \ntheir submission, if required.  \n \nAnyone expressing concerns in good faith will be protected from retaliation. Retaliation can occur in \nmany forms, including harassment, intimidation, demotion, or the assignment of unwanted tasks as a \nresult of making a report in good faith. Retaliation ag ainst workers who report is, in itself, a violation of \nthis Code. This will be investigated and, if proven, sanctioned.  \n \nA good faith report is one in which the whistleblower believes that what they are reporting is true or that \nthere is a strong possibility that misconduct has occurred or is occurring, and the report was not made \nmaliciously. A report does not necessarily h ave to be substantiated to be made in good faith, but the \nwhistleblower must believe that it is a genuine concern of possible misconduct.  \n \nRegarding the use of the Whistleblower Channel, during 2023 a communication campaign was \nconducted to promote it by sending periodic emails to employees and placing posters in different parts \nof the facilities, among others.  \n \nComplementing the above, it should be noted that the Code of Ethics is available on the Company's \nintranet platforms and is publicly accessible; new workers entering the company must complete the \nCompliance e -learning course; and for the rest of the worker s, as the case may be, they can access each \nyear the “Reinforcement of Ethics and Compliance Program” course for executive, supervisory and \ngeneral roles. Likewise, the Ethics and Compliance Management carries out an annual training plan that \nincludes an o nboarding program for collaborators.  \n \nCrime Prevention Model  \n \nAs explained in item 3.1, SQM has a Crime Prevention Model, which includes a set of policies, \nprocedures, standards, and controls that constitute a preventive and monitoring process through different  \n3      OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     47 control activities on the processes that are exposed to the risks of committing the crimes indicated in \nLaw 20,393. The Model establishes the Prevention, Detection, and Response activities and the roles of \neach of the stakeholders involved in the CPM. This  document sets out the activities that involve the \ncompany's Crime Prevention Officer, as well as the different support areas.  \n \nDuring the year 2023, and by virtue of the legislative changes that incorporate Law 21,595 on Economic \nCrimes, the company has carried out a process of risk assessment and identification of controls associated \nwith a new catalog of crimes stipulated in sai d legal body. In this way, it ensures that a program is \nestablished that is effective in preventing the commission of any crime that could affect the Company.  \n \nAs of today, the Company is constantly reviewing said CPM and in the process of recertification, \nconsidering the profound changes that the law itself has established in this regard.  \n \n3.7 RELA TIONSHIP  WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC  \n \nRegarding the units and channels of relations with interest groups identified in Section 6.3 of this Report, \nSQM has the Investor Relations area and the Communications area in the case of the press. Also through \nour social networks.  \n \nIn the case of Shareholders and Investors, their means of contact is email ir@sqm.com .

Also, investors can find out \neverything that happens in the company through the portal especially focused on them on the website : \nhttps://ir.sqm.com/English/home/default.aspx   \n \nIn addition to strictly complying with the legal obligations related to market disclosures, SQM has a \nseries of additional mechanisms that allow it to disseminate these relevant facts, as well as the Company's \nperformance, to a wider public through press r eleases issued by the Communications unit. (See summary \ntable on following page)  \n \nAt the same time, these units, together with SQM's Sustainability area, prepare the Annual Report and \nSustainability Report and disseminate them to all stakeholders, along with other communication media, \nallowing stakeholders to evaluate the information reported on the Company's economic, social, and \nenvironmental performance. This feedback is given through surveys and consultations that are managed \nboth via e -mail ( sustentabilidad@sqm.com ; ir@sqm.com ) and social media platforms, as well as in \nperson, in the case of the Sustainability Report, when it is presented to the communities in the area of \ninfluence of the Company's operations in various on -site meetings.  \n \nThese mechanisms as a whole provide valuable input and information for continuous improvement in \nthe process of developing and disseminating topics of interest.  \n \nBelow are the main channels and forums for relations with SQM's stakeholders, as well as the frequency \nwith which they are carried out:\n  \n3      OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     48 Main Relationship Channels with Stakeholders  \n \nStakeholders  How We Engage and Communicate  \nEmployees  Daily interactions in the workplace/ Direct communication between supervisors and area managers and \nthe workers reporting to them/ Regular union meetings,  meetings between workers, management, senior \nvice-presidents and managers.

STRATEGY  \nSQM is a global company that develops and produces diverse products for various industries essential \nto human progress such as health, nutrition, clean energy, and technology, through innovation and \ntechnological advancement. Our goal is to sustain our world leadership position in the lithium, potassium \nnitrate, iodine, and salts markets.  \n• Securing access to the best assets related to our current businesses, expanding our global \npresence  \n• Actively pursuing attractive minerals, allowing us opportunities for diversification to replicate \nand expand our current mining capabilities  \n• Strengthening our operational, logistical, and commercial excellence, from end to end, while \nseeking to be cost leaders; and  \n• Maintaining a conservative financial policy that allows us to successfully face economic cycles \nthat could affect the markets where we sell.  \nWe are a dynamic company. In pursuit of our goals, we expect to acquire and develop projects and \ninterests that are consistent with our existing and new businesses, either alone or with joint venture \npartners. We may also divest or sell interests we have a cquired to deploy funds for other investments or \nother purposes in pursuit of our goals or to adjust risk or diversify our asset base.  \nWe are a company built and managed by a culture based on excellence, safety, sustainability, and \nintegrity. We work every day to expand this culture by fostering talent attraction, retention, and \ndevelopment, as well as an inclusive work environment to ensure distinctive knowledge and innovation \nto sustain our business. We strive for safe and accident -free operations by promoting behaviors that \npromote the physical safety and psychol ogical well -being of all those who work directly and indirectly \nwith the Company.  \nWe position ourselves as leaders in sustainability and are committed to a sustainable future where we \nwork consistently to responsibly manage natural resources, protect human rights, care for the \nenvironment, build close and trusting relationships with our  neighboring communities, and create value. \nWithin these communities, we support projects and activities with a focus on education, business \ndevelopment, and protection of the environment and historical heritage.  \nWe create value for our customers through established business models and the production and \ndevelopment of distinguishing products that respond to the specific needs of the industry and the market, \nconstantly creating and providing a sustainable improveme nt in quality of life. We will continue to create \nvalue for all of our stakeholders through responsible natural resource management, sustainable expansion \nprojects, and enhancement of our existing operations, with a focus on minimizing our environmental \nimpacts by reducing our carbon, energy, and water footprints and working together with our \nshareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and communities.   \nBelow is our strategy per business line : \n \n  \n5 OUR PEOPL E   51 Specialty Plant Nutrition  \nOur strategy in our specialty plant nutrition business is to: (i) leverage the advantages of our specialty \nproducts over basic type fertilizers; (ii) selectively expand our business by increasing our sales of higher -\nmargin specialty plant nutrients based o n potassium and natural nitrates, particularly soluble potassium \nnitrate and specialty blends; (iii) seek investment opportunities in complementary businesses to improve \nour product portfolio, increase production, reduce costs and add value to the marketin g of our products; \n(iv) develop new specialty nutrient blends produced at our blending plants that are strategically located \nin or near our core markets to meet specific customer needs; (v) focus primarily on markets where we \ncan sell our plant nutrients i n soluble and foliar applications to establish a leadership position; (vi) further \ndevelop our global distribution and marketing system directly and through strategic alliances with other \nglobal or local producers and distributors; (vii) reduce our product ion costs through better processes and \nhigher labor productivity to compete more effectively and (viii) supply a product with consistent quality \nin accordance with the specific requirements of our customers.  \nIodine and Derivatives  \nOur strategy in our iodine business is to: (i) achieve and maintain sufficient market share in the iodine \nmarket to optimize the use of our available production capacity; (ii) encourage growth in demand and \npromote new uses of iodine; (iii) participate in iodine recycling projects through the Ajay -SQM Group \n(“ASG”); (iv) reduce our production costs through better processes and higher productivity to compete \nmore effectively and (v) supply a product with consistent quality following our customers’ requiremen ts. \nLithium and Derivatives  \nOur strategy in our lithium business is to: (i) strategically allocate our sales of lithium carbonate and \nlithium hydroxide; (ii) encourage growth in demand and promote new uses of lithium; (iii) selectively \npursue opportunities in the lithium derivatives business through the creation of new lithium compounds; \n(iv) reduce our production costs through better processes and greater productivity to compete more \neffectively; (v) supply a product with consistent quality in accordance with the requirements of our \ncustomers; (vi) diversify our operations geographically and jurisdictionally; and (vii) diversify our asset \nbase or adjust risk by acquiring new projects and interests (either alone or through joint venture partners), \ndivesting existing projects or selling  our interests in projects.  \nPota ssium  \nOur strategy in our potassium business is to: (i) have flexibility to offer products in crystallized (standard) \nor granular (compacted) form in accordance with market requirements; (ii) focus on markets where we \nhave logistical advantages and synergies with our specialty plant nutrition business and (iii) supply a \nproduct with consistent quality in accordance with the specific requirements of our customers.  \nIndustrial Chemicals   \nOur strategy in our industrial chemicals business is: (i) maintain our leadership position in the industrial \nnitrates market; (ii) encourage demand growth in different applications, as well as explore new potential \napplications; (iii) position ourselves as a reliable long -term supplier for the thermal storage industry, \nmaintaining close relationships with R&D programs and industrial initiatives; (iv) reduce our production \ncosts through better processes and higher productivity to compete more effectively and (v) supply a \nproduc t with consistent quality in accordance with the requirements of our customers.   \n5 OUR PEOPL E   52 4.1 TIME HORIZONS  \nItems of property, plant and equipment are depreciated by distributing their cost over their estimated \ntechnical useful life on a straight -line basis, which is the period the Company expects to use them. When \nseparate components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are \nrecorded as separate items and depreciated over their own useful lives. Useful lives are reviewe d \nannually.  \nThe useful lives of items of property, plant, and equipment located in the Salar de Atacama are the lesser \nof their technical useful life and the remaining years to 2030.  \nSpecific items of mobile equipment are depreciated on the basis of operational hours.  \nThe principal useful lives used to depreciate property, plant and equipment are as follows in years:  \nClases de Propiedades Plantas y \nEquipos  Vida o tasa mínima \nen años  \n(corto plazo)  Vida o tasa máxima \nen años  \n(largo plazo)  Vida o tasa \npromedio en años \n(mediano plazo)  \nMining assets1 5 10 8 \nPower generating assets  5 16 8 \nBuildings  4 25 13 \nHousehold goods and accessories  4 15 8 \nOffice equipment  5 10 6 \nTransportation equipment  6 20 9 \nNetwork and communications \nequipment  4 12 7 \nComputer equipment  4 11 7 \nMachinery, plants and equipment  3 24 11 \nOther fixed assets  3 20 9 \n1 Within the mining equipment there are SQM Australia exploration assets, which are amortized based on units produced.  \n4.2 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  \n \nOur Strategy, how do we understand our approach?  \n \nThe approach of a responsible business strategy includes, by definition, sustainability in its design and \noperation. When we evaluate and analyze, we make the decision to commit to sustainability in the \nbusiness, which is set out in our Sustainability, Eth ics, and Human Rights Policy. Then, we define our \nstrategic axes that respond to the materialization of our purpose. From this approach we organize \nbusiness development proposals based on establishing targets and goals and linking them to the SDG \ntargets t hat are integrated into these definitions.  \n \nAt the same time, we work to reduce our ecological footprint throughout our value chain, from our \nsuppliers to our production and responsible consumption practices. We have set targets related to \ndecarbonization, biodiversity conservation, and environmenta l impact reduction. Responsible action is \npart of our culture. This also includes respecting the interests of our employees, customers, investors, \nand the community.   \n5 OUR PEOPL E   53  \nIn addition, our business has been marked by constant innovation challenges, which have become \nopportunities to strengthen the internal management of our business. Given the above, there are constant \nchanges and adaptations.  \n \nOur innovative, high-quality products help us contribute to solving global challenges and, at the same \ntime, ensure our financial performance. Safety and ethics are fundamental drivers for a sustainable \napproach to our business, both for labor relations and for our stakeh olders.  \n \nWe mitigate ethical, economic, social, and environmental risks by applying strong control measures. We \nstrive to minimize our impact on the environment by applying safe and innovative production techniques, \ngenerating high environmental standards and stric t quality management, which are key processes for our \norganization. Moreover, we aim to strengthen our company by recruiting, developing, and motivating \ntalented employees.  \n \nWe closely follow new global trends and challenges. To understand the nature and complexity of the \nexpected changes, we make use of the so -called scenario technique, which allows us to identify and \nincorporate aspects that are of strategic relevance. We al so participate in dialogues and initiatives, share \nlessons learned and best practices with other organizations in our industry, and assess developments of \ncross -cutting concern to humanity. This allows us to minimize risks while taking advantage of new \nbusiness opportunities.  \n \nOur Sustainability Plan  \n \nOur Sustainability Plan commits us to meeting new environmental, social, and governance requirements \nand expectations. We have developed a plan based on the United Nations Sustainable Development \nGoals, which is complemented by a series of initiatives to e nsure that we live in harmony with the \nenvironment, the communities surrounding our operations, and our own employees.  \n \nThe plan has 3 work pillars, based on which we have set medium - and long -term goals in the areas of: \nwater, carbon neutrality, waste management, ecosystem protection, contributing to sustainable \nindustries, as well as the co -creation of value with communit ies and workers.  \n \nContributions to Sustainable Industries  \n• To continue being a relevant player in the sustainable development of the world, with a high \nparticipation in key industries for human development (health, food, renewable energies, and \nsustainable mobility) that improve the quality of life of people aroun d the world.  \n• To build trust and credibility for years to come, enhancing a brand that is publicly associated \nwith the world's other green industries.  \n \nOur People  \n• Establish a strong local presence and be a good neighbor.  \n• Participate in sustainable value co -creation with communities over time.  \n• Enhance local economies and the development of neighboring communities, contributing to the \ncreation of shared social value.  \n• All SQM employees are responsible community agents.  \n• Through its operations, SQM ensures  safe and inclusive working conditions while participating \nin local economies and the sustainable development of neighboring communities.  \n \nOur Environment   \n5 OUR PEOPL E   54  \n• Improve the monitoring systems of the ecosystems that surround our operations in order to \nprovide an even more timely response.  \n•  \n• Aim to reduce brine extraction by 50% by 2030, a process that began with a 20% reduction in \nextraction in November 2020.  \n• Aim to reduce continental water consumption by 65% by 2040, starting with a decrease of \n40% by 2030, as projected in 2020.  \n• Aspire to be carbon neutral in all our products from the origin to the end customer by the year \n2040 and in the case of lithium by the year 2030.  \n• Creation of a corporate waste management system to promote a cultural change towards \nSustainability. The first step is to measure, and then know how to reduce, also include those of \nyour suppliers, workers, collaborators, and offices in Chile and the rest of the world.  \n• SQM is committed to responsibly managing the natural resources used, tending to minimize \ntheir direct impact on flora and fauna, and working together with communities to support the \ncare and protection of these ecosystems.  \n \nSDG and Business Strategy Goals  \n \n \n \n5 OUR PEOPL E   55 At the center   \n \nSDG Integration into the Business Strategy  \nSDG  12 y SDG  13  \n(12) Responsible consumption and production and (13) Climate action:  We work towards responsible \nconsumption  and production as part of our purpose.

Additionally, \nsignificant capital expenditures are required every year in o rder to sustain our production capacity. We \nare focused on developing new products in response to identified customer demand, as well as new \nproducts that can be derived as part of our existing production or other products that could fit our long -\nterm development strategy.  \n \nOur capital expenditures in Chile have been mainly related to the organic growth and sustainability of \nour business, including the construction of new facilities and the renovation of plants and equipment. In \n2023, we also worked on the expansion of our li thium carbonate and lithium hydroxide capacity in Chile, \nwhich reached 200,000 metric tons and 30,000 metric tons respectively, by the end of 2023. We also \ncontinued with expansions related to the mining and production facilities of nitrates and iodine in Chile, \nwith our operations at Pampa Blanca delivering additional nitrates and iodine production volumes.  \n \nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows : \n \n(In mil ions of US$)  2023 2022 2021 \nCapital expenditures ……………….  1.103,6  905,2  464,7  \n \n2023  \nDuring 2023, we had total capital expenditures of US$1,103.6 million. Our 2023  capital expenditure was \nprimarily related to:  \n• Capacity expansion projects related to the completion of the increase of our lithium carbonate \nproduction in Chile from 180,000 metric tons per year to 210,000 metric tons per year by the \nend of 2024;  \n• Capacity expansion of lithium hydroxide production in Chile from 30,000 metric tons per year \nto 100,000 metric tons per year by 2025;  \n• Investment in Mt. Holland lithium project in Western Australia, completion of mine and \nconcentrator capacity and construction of refinery to produce 50,000 metric tons of lithium \nhydroxide in 2025.  \n• Investment in the development of new caliche projects in Pampa Blanca and Nueva Victoria to \nincrease the iodine and nitrate production capacity; and  \n• General maintenance of all production facilities, among others.  \n2022 \nDuring 2022, we had total capital expenditures of US$905.2 million. Our 2022 capital expenditure was \nprimarily related to:  \n• Capacity expansion projects related to the completion of our increase of our lithium carbonate \nproduction in Chile from 120,000 metric tons per year to 180,000 metric tons per year by the \nend of 2022;  \n• Completion of capacity expansion of lithium hydroxide production in Chile from 21,500 metric \ntons per year to 30,000 metric tons per year;   \n5 OUR PEOPL E   59 • Investment in our new 50,000 metric ton Mt. Holland lithium hydroxide mine and refining plant \nin Western Australia;  \n• Acquisition of the 20,000 metric ton lithium hydroxide refining plant in China; and  \n• Investment in the development of new caliche projects to optimize the iodine and nitrate \nproduction plants and carry out general maintenance of all production facilities, among others.  \n2021  \nDuring 2021, we had total capital expenditures of US$464.7 million. Our 2021 capital expenditure was \nprimarily related to:  \n• Capacity expansion projects related to the completion of our increase of our lithium carbonate \nproduction in Chile from 70,000 metric tons per year to 120,000 metric tons per year by the end \nof 2021 and investment in further lithium carbonate production capacity ex pansion from 120,000 \nto 180,000 metric tons per year in 2022;  \n• Completion of capacity expansion of lithium hydroxide production in Chile from 13,500 metric \ntons per year to 21,500 metric tons per year and commencement of a further expansion of lithium \nhydroxide production capacity in Chile from 21,500 metric tons per year to 30,000 metric tons \nper year in 2022;  \n• Investment in our new 50,000 metric ton Mt. Holland lithium hydroxide facility in Western \nAustralia;  \n• Optimization projects related to iodine production plants in Nueva Victoria; and  \n• General maintenance of all production units in order to ensure the fulfillment of production and \nsales targets.  \nWe believe that our capital expenditures for 2024 could reach approximately US$1.3 billion focused on \nthe increase of our production capacity, primarily related to lithium hydroxide capacity and nitrates and \niodine capacity expansions in Chile, constructio n of a lithium hydroxide refinery in Australia as part of \nour Mt. Holland lithium project in Western Australia, as well as the maintenance of our production \nfacilities in order to strengthen our ability to meet our production goals. We expect our installed  capacity \nof lithium carbonate in Chile to reach approximately 210,000 metric tons during 2024, while we will \ncontinue with our lithium hydroxide capacity expansion to reach 100,000 metric tons in 2025. We will \nalso continue to invest in the construction o f our Mt. Holland lithium hydroxide refinery in Western \nAustralia and will complete the acquisition of the lithium hydroxide production plant in China to produce \nfrom lithium sulfate.  \nWe expect our capital expenditure for the 2024 -2025 period to reach approximately US$2.4 billion, \nincluding maintenance. As we continue with lithium capacity expansion in Chile, we expect to invest \napproximately US$1.4 billion to increase our lithium capac ity to 210,000 metric tons by 2024, including \n100,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide capacity by 2025. Our investment in the Mt. Holland project \nand exploration projects in Australia during this period is expected to be close to US$340 million. \nNitrates and iodine capacity expansion will require a total capex of approximately US$700 million, \nincluding maintenance. Maintenance capex during this period is expected to be approximately US$150 \nmillion per annum  \n   \n5 OUR PEOPL E   60 5. OUR PEOPLE  \n \nPeople are the center and the basis of our activities.

We do not have plans or targets to reduce wage inequalities; however, our goal is to provide \nour employees with the opportunities and condit ions necessary for each of them to develop and \ncontribute in an environment of cordiality, equality, respect, and openness. To this end, in our \nSustainability, Ethics, and Human Rights Policy, in our Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Approach, we \nhave def ined the following development axes:  \n \n• Ensuring no salary discrimination, hiring, promoting, and making employment decisions based \non objective criteria related to the person's aptitude for the position.  \n \n• Development of activities or programs aimed at target audiences that require improvement or \npreparation.  \n \n• Blind recruitment, evaluating applicants according to their competencies and requirements for \nthe position, with no discrimination of any kind.  \n \n5.4.2 Wage Gap  \n \nThe wage gap presented was calculated using the gross hourly wage of each labor category considering \nworkers active as of December 31, 2023. People working abroad and the subsidiary Ajay are excluded \nfrom the calculation.  \n \nThe gaps reported are mainly due to the fact that the data represent Group companies with very different \nlines of business, and therefore, the roles of their employees and their job evaluations differ.  \n \nIn the case of operators, their salaries are established in the collective bargaining agreements and are the \nsame for each position for both men and women. Each position has a different remuneration according \nto its evaluation. Moreover, we meet the gender gap measured in the Chilean Norm n°3262 certification \nprocess.  \nSalary Gap by Position  Category, Mean  and Median  \nPosition Category  Average Salary Gap  Median Salary Gap  \nSenior Management  58% 70% \nManagers  85% 82% \nDivision Head  99% 104%  \nOperators  90% 95% \nSales Force  N/A N/A \nAdministrator  99% 104%  \nAuxiliary  100%  100%  \nOther Professionals  92% 82% \nOther Technicians  90% 88% \nN/A: It does not apply because it includes people who work in Chile and have the same sex .  \n5 OUR PEOPL E   69 5.5 WORKPLACE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT  \n \nThe company has a procedure for investigating sexual harassment, which is contained in the RIOHS \n(Internal Regulations for Order, Hygiene and Safety), as well as a procedure for investigating and \nsanctioning workplace harassment contained in the same regulation.  \n \nAs part of the above procedures, the company has set up a website for reporting complaints related to \nthe ethics hotline, including complaints regarding workplace and sexual harassment (web site: \nwww.SQM.ethicspoint.com ), Chile, Belgium, USA, Mexico, Spain, South Africa, Ecuador, China \n(Shanghai), China (Beijing).  \n \nIn case of complaints, these can be received through the specified channels or directly by the human \nresources teams deployed in all locations in the country, which are analyzed and investigated within a \nperiod not exceeding 30 days.  \n \nIn 2023, the following complaints of harassment were filed both at SQM and at the Labor Directorate \n(DT):  \nSubject   \nN° of \ncases  Labor Directorate  (DT)  Conclu sions  \nLabor harrasment  4 The result was reported to \nthe DT in all cases  3 cas es not proven ; 1 cas e proven  \n(dismissal ) \nSexual harrasment  2 1  case was investigated \ndirectly by the DT  1 case proven ; 1 cas e not proven  \nTotal  6   \n \nDuring 2023, the Ethics and Compliance Management carried out a training program in person, online \nand through e -learning on Management matters, with special emphasis on the Corporate Code of Ethics. \nThis training material incorporated aspects related to workplace and sexual harassment for the \nCompany's workers, of which 78.5% and 76.9% of Supervisors and Executives, respectively, were \ntrained.  \n \n5.6 OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY  \nWorkplace health and safety are material aspects of managing mining operations. For this reason, SQM \nhas a permanent, systematic process to keep workers protected and safe in each of the tasks they perform \nin its operations. In addition to the role played by the Company in this important matter, the Chilean \nState has a regulatory function, enacting and enforcing regulations to protect and ensure worker health \nand safety. The Chilean Government, acting through the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the \nMinistry of Health, and Sernageomin, oversees occupational health and safety standards at mining sites; \nin particular, Sernageomin supervises mining projects, among other tasks, and has exclusive powers to \nenforce standards related to environmental conditio ns and the health and safety of persons engaged in \nmining -related activities.  \n \nAs mentioned above, SQM has a Sustainability, Ethics, and Human Rights Policy that sets out its \ncommitment to the sustainable development of its business, as well as to guaranteeing Occupational \nHealth and Safety and respect for the people who work at its facilities, the community, and its customers.  \n \nTo this end, it has a Risk Prevention and Occupational Health Management System capable of \nidentifying, developing, and sustaining behaviors and conditions that guarantee the care of all those who \nwork at the Company's sites, projects, and offices. This po licy applies to all SQM operations.   \n5 OUR PEOPL E   70  \nAs part of the operationalization of its Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) commitments, SQM has \ndeveloped an Integrated Occupational Health and Safety System, the purposes of which are as follows:  \n \n• To establish obligations and responsibilities in order to  adopt all necessary measures to \neffectively protect and safeguard the life and health of all employees working at SQM, including \ncontractors and subcontractors.  \n \n• To define and establish standards to control all risks inherent to the processes, in order to define \nand set the minimum specifications for Occupational Health and Safety Management.  \n \n• To safeguard the facilities, equipment, machinery, and all critical materials related to SQM's \noperations and processes.  \n \nAs part of the implementation of the Occupational Health and Safety management system, SQM has \ndeveloped an Operational Risk Management System (SISGRO), which contains a series of activities \ngrouped into 13 elements:  \n  \nAll these SISGRO activities are integrated into the Operational Excellence Program, called M1, which \nallows us to homologate the tools of the M1 Lean system to risk management, thus obtaining better \nresults.  \n \nThe following are the main indicators of SQM's Occupational Health and Safety management, which \ncorrespond only to management in Chile. We are updating our internal processes so that this information \nis available soon. Regarding the Occupational Safety goa ls for the \"Accident Rate per 100 workers\", \n\"Occupational Illness Rate per 100 workers\" and \"Average Days Lost due to accidents\", the information \nis not available, since the targets have yet to be defined as requested by General Character Norm  461. \nWe expe ct to define these targets in the medium term.

Our objective is to build honest, clear, fair and \nlasting relationships with all our busines s partners associated with the company or any of its SQM \nsubsidiaries around the world.  \n \nAlso, we seek to extend our commitments to sustainability, good labor practices and human rights to our \nsupply chain with a view to promoting responsible and sustainable sourcing. Therefore, we commercially \nand contractually urge our suppliers to protect the health and safety of their workers, to respect their \nlabor rights and human rights, and to protect the environment. To this end, we have progressively \nincorporated into our evaluations the criteria of sustainability and compliance with adequate working \nconditions, in the continuous monitoring and risk assessment of our suppliers, also incorporating into \nour purchasing decisions for inputs and services criteria associated with our regulatory documents.  \n \nOn the other hand, we have an Operational Risk Management System (SISGRO) that allows us to verify \nthat service provider companies (contractors and subcontractors) comply with all legal provisions in \nforce in our country for their good performance. The Contract Bases establish the accident rates that \nmust be met by those companies that wish to provide services in SQM, which must be “in or under” the \nranges established for economic activity. The obligation is also established for any company to establish \na Risk Prevention Program aligned with SQM's Compr ehensive Occupational Health and Safety \nManagement System.  \n \nAlong these same lines, periodically, we carry out a control of labor variables, to measure compliance \nwith labor and pension obligations of all contracting companies. External companies are controlled in \nterms of people's health and safety, basic sanitary and environmental conditions in the workplace, health \nand safety management system, constitution and operation of joint committees and compliance with \nlabor legislation.  \n \nIn addition, coordination meetings are held between the principal's professional administrator, its \nprevention department and a representative of each contractor and subcontractor, the first of which is at \nthe beginning of each contract.  \n \nSQM's Controls for Contractors and Subcontractors  \n \n• That they be advised by an Expert in Occupational Risk Prevention, according to the number of \nworkers they have.  \n• That they constitute their own Joint Committee.  \n• That the Joint Committees operate as provided for by law.  \n• That the Joint Committees send their committee meeting minutes to the Technical Administrator \nof the contract.  \n• That worker's representatives be invited to participate in training activities and meetings of the \nSite Joint Committee.  \n• That they have drawn up and delivered their internal regulations to their workers.  \n• That they inform their workers of their occupational hazards.  \n• That their employees have and effectively use Personal Protective Equipment.  \n \nResponsible Sourcing Policy  \n \nThis Policy establishes criteria for responsible sourcing, which our suppliers shall progressively \nincorporate in their organizations in order to ensure a human rights -compliant supply chain. The Policy \nis structured based on the 5 pillars of the Sustainab ility, Ethics, and Human Rights Policy: (i) Ethics and  \n5 OUR PEOPL E   77 Corporate Governance; (ii) Employees; (iii) Value Chain; (iv) Environment and Sustainable \nDevelopment; and (v) Communities. The criteria to be met by SQM's suppliers to ensure responsible \nsourcing throughout its supply chain are established for each pillar . \n \nResponsible Sourcing Policy Compliance Criteria  \n \nEthics and Corporate Governance  \n• Expressly commit to the fundamental human rights and business pillars of \"protect, respect, and \nremedy\".  \n• Fully comply with anti -corruption laws when working on behalf of SQM.  \n• Ensure that processes and supply chains are free of minerals from conflict zones.  \n• Ensure that no direct or indirect funding or benefits are provided to armed groups in countries \nin conflict zones according to OECD guidelines, published at \nhttps://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/OECD -Due-Diligence -Guidance -Minerals . \n• Combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and non -state armed groups.

OUR BUSINESS  \n6.1 INDUSTRIAL SECTOR  \n \nSQM is an integrated producer and marketer of specialty plant nutrients, iodine and derivatives, lithium \nand derivatives, potassium fertilizers and industrial chemicals. The Company's products are based on the \ndevelopment of high quality natural resources that allow SQM to be a cost leader, supported by a \nspecialized international commercial network with sales in more than 100 countries.  \nIt should be noted that according to the Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS), SQM belongs \nto the Chemical Substances industry.  \nNature of the Company’s  products  \n \nSQM estimates that it is the world's leading producer of lithium, iodine and potassium nitrate. The \nCompany also produces specialty plant nutrients, lithium and iodine derivatives, potassium chloride, \npotassium sulfate and certain industrial chemicals (inc luding solar salts and industrial nitrates). SQM's \nproducts are sold in more than 100 countries through its worldwide distribution network, with 98% of \nsales made abroad during the 2023 period.  \nThe Company's products are currently mainly derived from mineral deposits found in northern Chile. \nThus, SQM develops mining and processes caliche and brine deposits. The caliche ore in northern Chile \ncontains the only known deposits of nitrate and iodine in the world and is the world's largest \ncommercially exploited source of natural nitrate. The brine deposits of the Salar de Atacama, a salt \ndepression in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, contain high concentrations of lithium and \npotassium, as well a s significant concentrations of magnesium sulfate and boron.  \nFrom the caliche ore deposits, SQM generates a wide range of nitrate -based products used for specialty \nplant nutrients and industrial applications, as well as iodine and iodine derivatives. In the Salar de \nAtacama, brines rich in potassium, lithium and sul fate are extracted to produce potassium chloride, \npotassium sulfate, lithium chloride solutions and bischofite (magnesium chloride).  \nThe Company produces lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide at its plant near the city of Antofagasta, \nChile, from solutions extracted from the Salar de Atacama. Also, starting in the second half of 2023, \nSQM began producing lithium hydroxide from its refining plant in China from lithium sulfate sourced \nfrom the Salar de Atacama.  \nTowards the end of 2023, the Company commenced production of spodumene concentrate from the Mt. \nHolland project, located in Perth, Australia.  \nInformation on the Company's results is disclosed on the basis of six operating segments, as required by \nIFRS/IFRS: specialty plant nutrients, iodine and derivatives, lithium and derivatives, industrial \nchemicals, potassium and other products and services.   \nSpecialty plant nutrients are premium fertilizers that enable farmers to improve yields and the quality of \ncertain crops. Iodine and its derivatives are used primarily in the X -ray contrast medium, biocide \nindustries and in the production of polarizing fil m, which is an important component of liquid crystal \ndisplay (\"LCD/LED\") screens. Lithium and its derivatives are mainly used in batteries, greases and frits \nfor the production of ceramics. Potassium chloride is a commodity fertilizer that the Company prod uces  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 80 and sells worldwide. Industrial chemicals have a wide range of applications in certain chemical processes \nsuch as glass production, explosives, ceramics, solar thermal use and metal treatment. In addition, SQM \ncomplements its portfolio of plant nutrients t hrough the purchase and sale of other commodity fertilizers.  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had revenues of $7,467.5 million, gross profit of $3,075.1 \nmillion and profit attributable to controlling interests of $2,012.7 million. Our market capitalization at \nDecember 31, 2023 was approximately US$16.9 billi on. \nThe following table presents the percentage breakdown of the Company's revenues for 2023, 2022 and \n2021 according to its operating segments:  \n \n 2023  2023  2021  \nSpecialty Plant Nutrition  12% 11% 32% \nIodine and Derivatives  12% 7% 15% \nLithium and Derivatives  69% 76% 33% \nPotassiu m  4% 4% 15% \nIndustrial chemicals  2% 2% 5% \nOther s  0% 0% 1% \nTotal  100%  100%  100%  \nTotal (US$ millions)  7.467,5  10.710,6  2.862,3  \n \nCompetition faced by the entity in the industrial sector  \n \nWithin the industrial sector to which SQM belongs, the Company faces competition from other \nmanufacturers of chemical products similar to those produced and marketed by SQM. Details of the \nCompany's main competitors are presented by their respective market s in Section 6.2 of this Report.  \nREGULATORY OR LEGAL FRAMEWORK  \n \nStandards in Chile at a general level  \nSQM is subject to a wide range of laws, decrees, regulations, standards and governmental oversight that \nare generally applicable to companies engaged in business in Chile, including labor, social security, \npublic health, consumer protection, tax, environme ntal, antitrust and securities laws. Such legislation \nalso includes regulations to ensure sanitary and safety conditions in manufacturing plants.  \nThe Company conducts its mining operations pursuant to exploitation and exploration concessions \ngranted under applicable Chilean legislation. The exploitation concessions essentially grant a perpetual \nright (with the exception of the rights related to SQM' s operations in the Salar de Atacama that have been \nleased to the Company until 2030) to conduct mining operations in the areas covered by such \nconcessions, provided that the annual mining patents associated with such concessions are paid. \nExploration conc essions allow exploration to verify the existence of mineral resources in the lands \ncovered by them for a specific period and subsequently request the corresponding exploitation \nconcession.  \nPursuant to Law No. 16,319, the Company has an obligation to the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission \n(\"CCHEN\") in connection with the exploitation and sale of lithium from the Salar de Atacama, which \nprohibits it from being used for nuclear fusion purposes. In addition, CCHEN has imposed cumulative \nlimits on the tonnage of lithium authorized to be sold, among other conditions.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 81 SQM also has water rights conferred by the respective administrative authority that allow it to have a \nwater supply from rivers and wells near its production facilities, which are sufficient to meet current \noperational requirements. See Section 3.6, Risk Management of this Annual Report.  \nSQM operates the Tocopilla port facilities for the shipment of products and reception of raw materials \nin accordance with the maritime concessions granted by the respective administrative authority. Such \nconcessions are normally renewable, provided that su ch facilities are used as authorized and the \nassociated annual fees are paid.  \nIn 2005, Law No. 20,026 established a tax or royalty to be applied to mining activities carried out in \nChile. In 2010, amendments were made to this Law and taxes were increased.  \nOn February 24, 2020, Law No. 21,210 was published, which \"Modernizes Tax Legislation\". As a result \nof these reforms, open corporations, such as SQM, are subject to the general regime. The corporate tax \nrate applicable to the Company was increased to 27% i n 2018.  \nIn addition, SQM is subject to the Labor Code and also to the Subcontracting Law No. 20,123, which \nare supervised by the Labor Directorate, Sernageomin and the National Health Service.  \nFurthermore, the Company is subject to Law No. 20,393 which establishes the criminal liability of legal \nentities for crimes such as (a) money laundering, (b) financing of terrorism, (c) bribery and (d) forcing \nemployees to comply with sanitary restrictions  ordered by local authorities, among others. Potential \nsanctions for violations of this law may include (i) fines, (ii) loss of certain tax benefits within a certain \nperiod, (iii) temporary or permanent prohibition against the organization from executing c ontracts with \ngovernmental entities and (iv) dissolution of the company.  \nOther regulatory frameworks with which SQM must comply are the Securities Market Law and Law \n18,046 on Corporations, which regulate corporate governance. Specifically, this law regulates, among \nother things, requirements for independent directors, disclosu re of obligations to the public and the CMF, \nas well as regulations regarding the use of internal information, independence of external auditors and \nprocesses for analyzing transactions with related companies.  \nOn June 21, 2022, Law No. 21,455 was published in the Official Gazette, which establishes a legal \nframework to face the challenges derived from climate change and to comply with the international \ncommitments of the State of Chile in this matter. Law No. 21 ,455 amends the Chilean Corporations Law \nby obliging open corporations registered in the Securities Registry to periodically provide information \nto the CMF regarding the impact of their activities on the environment and climate change.  \nLaw No. 21,521 was sanctioned by the President of the Republic on December 22, 2022 and published \nin the Official Gazette on January 4, 2023. The purpose of this Law is to promote competition and \nfinancial inclusion in the provision of financial services t hrough innovation and technology. Law No. \n21,521 regulates the following financial services: (i) crowdfunding platforms; (ii) alternative systems for \nthe transaction of financial instruments or securities; (iii) credit advice; (iv) investment advice; (v) \ncustody of financial instruments; (vi) routing of orders; and (vii) intermediation of financial instruments. \nThe Law also amends the Chilean Corporations Law by increasing to 2,000 (or such greater number as \ndetermined by the Financial Market Commission) th e number of shareholders that a closely -held \ncorporation must have in order to acquire the obligation to register its shares in the Securities Registry \nand, therefore, become an open corporation. In addition, Law No. 21,521 amends the Securities Law by \nestablishing a simplified regime for debt securities, which will be detailed by the CMF.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 82 There are currently no significant legal or administrative proceedings pending against the Company, \nexcept for those indicated in Section 8.1 of this Report.  \nSafety, Health and Environmental Standards in Chile  \nSQM's operations in Chile are subject to both national and local regulations related to safety, health and \nenvironmental protection. In Chile, the main regulations applicable to the Company in these matters are \nthe Mining Safety Regulation, the Sanitary Co de, the Regulation on Basic Sanitary and Environmental \nConditions in the Workplace, the Subcontracting Law, the Law on General Bases of the Environment \nand Law No. 16,744 of the Labor Code regarding work -related accidents and occupational diseases.  \nThe Norms on Occupational Accidents and Occupational Diseases and their complementary \nRegulations, together with the Mining Safety Regulations, protect workers and the surrounding \ncommunities from hazards to their health and safety. The Occupational Health  and Safety Standards, \ntogether with SQM's Internal Mining Safety Regulations, establish guidelines for maintaining a \nworkplace with adequately controlled health and safety risks.  \nIn November 2011, the Ministry of Mining enacted Decree No. 20,551 which \"Regulates the Closure of \nMining Sites and Facilities\". This law came into effect in November 2012 and required all mining sites \nto submit or update their closure plans as of November  2014, which SQM complied with for all of its \nsites. The main requirements of the law are related to the execution of measures to obtain the physical \nand chemical stability of the mine site and its facilities, as well as the protection of life, health, saf ety of \npeople and the environment, along with the estimated cost. to implement such plans. Site closure plans \nare approved by Sernageomin, and the corresponding financial guarantees are subject to approval by the \nCMF. In both cases, SQM received the necess ary approvals and the respective guarantees are maintained \nand updated according to the useful life of each mining site. During 2020, updates to the closure plans \nwere presented and submitted in accordance with the deadlines indicated by Sernageomin. In 20 21, the \nupdates of the Pedro de Valdivia and Tocopilla sites were approved. Likewise, the process continued in \naccordance with the comments received. During 2022, Sernageomin approved the updates of the closure \nplans for the Salar de Atacama Lithium Chemic al Plant, Coya Sur, Nueva Victoria and Orcoma mines. \nFinally, during 2023, the closure plan updates for the Pampa Blanca and María Elena sites were \napproved.  \nIn addition, over time new environmental rules and regulations have been enacted that have required \nminor adjustments or modifications to operations for full compliance. SQM is equally committed to both \ncomplying with all applicable environmental regulatio ns and to continuously improving its \nenvironmental performance through its Environmental Management System (\"EMS\").  \nIt should be noted that SQM has voluntary qualifications such as Ecovadis ; international certifications \nsuch as Responsible Care from the Chilean Chemical Industries Association; Protect & Sustain from the \nInternational Fertilizer Association; ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 50001; and the IRMA ( Initiative \nfor Responsible Mining Assurance ) Audited Standard to promote responsible mining.  \nIn 2021 Puerto Tocopilla was certified in Responsible Care, obtaining on that occasion level 2. In \naddition, during 2022 the Nueva Victoria mine was recertified, obtaining as a result level 1. It should be \nnoted that the Protect&Sustain certification appli es to the operations of Coya Sur, Salar de Atacama, \nAntofagasta, Santiago and Puerto Tocopilla.  \nIn terms of ISO management systems, the Port of Tocopilla obtained ISO 14001 certification in January \n2022. We completed the ISO 14001 and 45001 certification process at the Salar de Atacama and our \nLithium Chemical Plant. During 2023, we completed the ISO  14001 and 45001 recertification of our  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 83 management systems at the Salar de Atacama and our Lithium Chemical Plant and the ISO 50001 \nimplementation process at the Salar de Atacama, Nueva Victoria and Coya Sur operations to support the \ndecarbonization goals associated with energy. management syste ms. In 2023, the Port of Tocopilla was \ncertified by EcoPorts, a leading environmental initiative for the European port sector.  \nIn line with our sustainability objectives, during 2022 -2023 we continued with the IRMA assessment \nprocess and completed the on -site certification audit (phase 2) at the Salar de Atacama operation. In \nSeptember 2023, our Salar de Atacama lithium mining ope rations achieved IRMA 75, the highest score \nto date.  \nAs a result of our participation in the DJSI assessment during 2023, we were accepted into the DJSI \nWorld and Emerging Markets indices, two years ahead of our internal target, maintained our inclusion \nin the DJSI Mila and Chile indices, and were included i n the Sustainability Yearbook 2024. We also \ncompleted the CDP assessment for water in which we achieved a B rating category, a level above the \nworld average and the chemical industry average (category C).  \nSQM has submitted and will continue to submit environmental impact studies and statements for its \nprojects to governmental authorities whenever it is necessary to obtain environmental authorization to \nmaintain and increase production capacity.  \nSpecific regulations for mining operations in Western Australia  \nOur operations in Australia are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations imposed by local and \nfederal governments and regulatory bodies applicable to companies doing business in Australia. Tax \nregulations in Australia are governed by federal laws, s uch as income tax and goods and services tax, \nand are administered by the Australian Taxation Office. In addition, there are also some state -specific \nregulations for projects located in Western Australia (WE), including labor laws, occupational health \nand safety laws, payroll taxes, state mining royalties (payable on product extracted and sold) and \nenvironmental laws administered by different government departments. For SQM's Australian projects, \nspecific laws and regulations of both the Australian federal government and the Western Australian state \ngovernment apply.  \nIn Australia, the government owns the land and the rights to extract minerals from the land and allows \nparties to apply for tenure to explore or mine the land. SQM (directly or through joint ventures) has \nobtained from the WA government the mineral tenure right to conduct its exploration and mining \noperations in Australia. The Mining Act 1978 (WA) (\"WA Mining Act\") and the associated Mining \nRegulations 1981 (WA) govern exploration and mining on Western Australian land. Mining tenements \nunder the WA Mining A ct include mining leases (which grant the right to conduct mining operations in \nthe areas covered by such concessions, provided annual concession fees are paid and expenses are met), \nexploration licenses (which allow companies to explore for mineral resour ces on the land covered for a \nspecified period, and to subsequently apply for a corresponding mining lease) and miscellaneous licenses \nand general purpose leases, (for ancillary mining activities such as overhead infrastructure and \ngroundwater extraction, among others). The granting of a mining lease under the WA Mining Act and \nthe conditions imposed are at the discretion of the Minister of Mines and Petroleum. The right to explore \nusually carries with it an obligation to spend a specified amount of money o n exploration or to undertake \ncertain exploration activities.  \nSQM's operations are subject to both state and federal environmental laws and regulations, which may \ninvolve obtaining environmental approvals and licenses to conduct exploration and mining operations. \nThe Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservati on Act 1999 (Cth) (the \"EPBC Act\") is the  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 84 centerpiece of the Australian Government's environmental legislation. It provides a legal framework to \nprotect and manage flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage sites of national and international \nsignificance. Under the EPBC Act, new projects m ay require federal government approval if they have, \nwill have or are likely to have a significant impact on \"matters of national environmental significance.\" \nThe Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water manages \nthe referral and assessment process under the EPBC Act.  \nAt the state level, SQM is subject to the Environmental Protection Act of 1986 (WA) \"(EPA Act\"). Under \nthe EP Act, SQM is required to prevent, control and mitigate pollution and environmental damage and \nensure the conservation and protection (as appropriat e) of land subject to SQM's tenure. If a proposal is \nlikely to have a significant impact on the environment, it must be referred to the Western Australian \nEnvironmental Protection Authority to determine whether an environmental assessment is required. The \nWestern Australian Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS) ensures the \nresponsible development of Western Australia's mineral, petroleum and geothermal resources. This \nincludes DEMIRS along with the Western Australian Department of Wat er and Environment Regulation \n(DWER), which regulates the mining industry to ensure environmental compliance and the \nimplementation of environmental best management practices in accordance with obligations imposed by \nthe EPA Act and the WA Mining Act.  \nA recent update to Western Australia's health and safety requirements has resulted in the Work Health \nand Safety Act 2020 (WA), the Work Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2022 (WA) and the Work \nHealth and Safety (Mines) Regulations 2022 (WA). ) (coll ectively, \"WHS Act\"). The WHS Act updates \nthe former Mining Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (WA) and related regulations and now extends \npersonal responsibilities to company directors or persons running a business or undertaking (\"PCBU\") \nto comply with occu pational safety and health obligations. Under the WHS Act, PCBUs have a primary \nduty of care for the health and safety of workers while on the job (this also includes statutory positions \nsuch as senior site executives and exploration managers). The most si gnificant change in the WHS \nlegislation is the requirement for operating companies to have a Mine Safety Management System that \nincludes requirements addressing health monitoring, construction work, emergency management, fitness \nfor work, risk management, employee training and assurance activities.  \nIn Australia there have been a number of changes to federal labor laws and more are on the horizon. \nThese include amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the Sex Discrimination Act (Cth) \nthrough the changes \"Closing the loopholes\" and \"Respect at Wo rk\". \nChanges relevant to \"Closing the Loopholes\" include (i) prohibition of discrimination against employees \nwho have suffered family and domestic violence, (ii) changes to \"same work, same pay\" changes that \nprovide employees (or their representatives) the abil ity to apply for a \" regulated labor hire agreement \norder\" to require a labor hire provider to pay its employees no less than what they would be paid under \nthe host employer's business agreement, (iii) criminal offenses for intentional wage theft (includin g steep \nfines and prison sentences), and (iv) enhanced rights of shop stewards in the workplace.  \nThe Respect@Work changes introduce an obligation on employers to eliminate (i) workplace sexual \nharassment, sex discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex; (ii) conduct that amounts to subjecting \na person to a hostile work environment on the basis of sex; and (iii) certain acts of victimization. There \nis a particular focus on this issue in the Western Australian mining industry in light of the state \ngovernment report \"Enough is Enough: Sexual Harassment of Women in the FIFO Mining Industry\" \nreleased in September 2022. Some of the changes have already come into effect, and others will \ncommence throughout 2024 and early 2025. We also continue to monitor the progress of further changes  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 85 to \"Close the Loopholes\" and the introduction of the \"right to disconnect\" from work, which is expected \nlater this year.  \nThe Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (\"AH Act\") and the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (\"NTA Act\") \ngovern obligations relating to Aboriginal heritage and native title when undertaking activities on \nAustralian land. The AH Act protects and manages Aboriginal heritage by requiring approval for \nactivities that may affect or cause damage to Aboriginal heritage (such as archaeological and \nethnographic sites that are important to Aboriginal people), even if native title has lapsed. T he NTA \nprovides a procedure under which native title claims can be brought in the Federal Court and regulates \nall actions, including the granting of mineral estates, that affect native title rights. Prior to undertaking \nactivities on land in Western Austra lia, SQM must verify Aboriginal heritage. Under the AH Act, if an \nAboriginal heritage site is identified, there is a permitting and approvals regime for disturbing or \ndestroying Aboriginal heritage sites. Under Section 18 of the AH Act, the Minister may gi ve consent for \na tenured party (on land where Aboriginal heritage has been identified) to impact Aboriginal sites, i.e. \nby undertaking mining activities.  \nThe Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), a non -statutory advisory body established in \n1976, which reviews foreign investment proposals and advises the Treasurer and the Government on the \nnational interest implications of a proposal in accorda nce with Australia's foreign investment policy (i.e., \nthe Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth)). The Australian Treasurer is responsible for \nmaking the decision whether or not to approve foreign investment proposals. Like many countries, \nAustr alia reviews foreign investment proposals on a case -by-case basis to ensure that they are not \ncontrary to the national interest. The review framework is well established, practical and non -\ndiscriminatory.  \nInternational Standards  \nSQM is also subject to complex regulatory requirements in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, \nincluding the following implemented in 2023:  \nRegulation (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH) is the main framework for the control of chemicals in the EU. \nSQM acts as lead registrant for four substances: iodine, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and urea \nphosphate. At the end of 2022, Commission Regulation (EU) 20 20/878 replaced Annex II of REACH \nand introduces changes to the format of safety data sheets, a key hazard communication tool. \nConsequently, as of 2023, all documents issued by SQM's subsidiaries in Europe will have to comply \nwith this new format.  \nIn October 2023, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which introduces the reporting \nof greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embedded in direct and indirect imports into the EU, came into \nforce in a transitional phase. In the final scheme, emissions mu st be reported together with the \ncorresponding number of CBAM certificates priced according to the average weekly auction price of \nallowances in the EU Emissions Trading System. SQM's European legal entities reported in early 2024 \nthe emissions associated with the production of imported products during the fourth quarter of 2023.  \nWe continue our active participation as a member of the European Commission's Standing Committee \non Precursors, which monitors and assists in the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/1148 on the \nmarketing and use of explosives precursors. Invoices and sa fety data sheets for our products covered by \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1148 inform of such status so that our European users are informed and can take \nappropriate action, as well as product safety data sheets, where applicable. During 2023, an e -learning  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 86 course was implemented to train our company's employees in Europe covering basic regulatory concepts \non the marketing and use of explosives precursors.  \nIn May 2023, Ecuador published Ministerial Agreement No. 145, which establishes the requirements for \nauthorizations and permits for the import, export and commercialization of controlled chemical \nsubstances, including ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium a nd ammonium nitrate, among other \nsubstances. Currently, SQM Ecuador has authorizations for the import and distribution of controlled \nproducts included in its commercial portfolio in this country.  \nIn August 2023, the Regulations of Law No. 21,349 were published in Chile's Official Gazette, which \nestablished rules on the composition, labeling and marketing of fertilizers and biostimulants to be applied \nas of August 2026.  \nIn the area of international transportation, SQM actively participated through the Chilean Chemical \nIndustry Association in the 38th and 39th meetings of the Editorial and Technical Group and in the 9th \nmeeting of the Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers of the International Maritime \nOrganization (IMO ). \nIMO Maritime Safety Committee Resolution MSC.539(107) amended the International Maritime Solid \nBulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code) with the addition of new entries for potassium nitrate and sodium \nnitrate as Group C cargoes.  \nRegulatory entities  \nThe Company is registered in the Securities Registry of the Financial Market Commission (CMF) under \nNo. 184 of March 18, 1983, and is therefore subject to the supervision of this entity. In addition, as its \nshares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange through an ADR ( American Depository Receipts ) \nprogram, the Company is also subject to the regulations established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) applied to foreign issuers such as SQM.  \nStakeholders  \nSQM's main stakeholders are detailed in section 6.3 Stakeholders.  \nUnion membership  \nSQM is a member of the following associations:  \n• Corporate Action   \n• Chilean Association for Desalination and Reuse  \n• Chilean Hydrogen Association (H2 Chile)  \n• Concentrating Solar Power Association  \n• Antofagasta Industrial Association (AIA)  \n• Industrial Association of Iquique (AII)  \n• Chilean Chemical Industrialists Trade Association (ASIQUIM)  \n• Australian Chilean Chamber of Commerce (AUSCHAM)  \n• Chilean -Belgian -Luxemburgian Chamber of Commerce A.G.  \n• Chilean American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM)  \n• Santiago Chamber of Commerce  \n• Chinese -Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Tourism A.G.  \n• Regional Mining Safety Council (CORESEMIN) Antofagasta  \n• Regional Council for Mining Safety (CORESEMIN) Tarapacá   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 87 • Fundación Chile del Pacífico  \n• Fundación Generación Empresarial - FGE  \n• Chilean Institute of Rational Business Administration (ICARE)  \n• Institute of Engineers of Chile  \n• Global Compact Chile  \n• Society for Industrial Development (SOFOFA)  \n• National Mining Society (SONAMI)  \n• Spanish Commercial Association of Fertilizers (ACEFER)  \n• Spanish Association for the Valorization of Packaging (AEVAE)  \n• International Fertilizer Association (IFA)  \n• World Iodine Association (WIA)  \n• Asociación Nacional de Comercializadores y Productores de Fertilizantes A.C.(ANACOFER) \n(National Association of Fertilizer Dealers and Producers).  \n• Belgian Electrotechnical Committee npo (BEC)  \n• Drug, Chemical & Associated Technologies Association, Inc.

The latter are \nincreasingly used in high value fruit plantations as well as in protected crops: tunnels for berries and \ngreenh ouses for tomatoes. In addition, SQM participates in the specialty nutrients market for foliar and \ngranular applications to the soil, in certain high -value niches such as potato production.  \nAmong the specialty plant nutrients for use in fertigation, potassium nitrate is one of the most important \nfertilizers. Its advantage lies in being chlorine free, high solubility, adequate PH and free of impurities. \nThese advantages allow SQM as a major pr oducer of potassium nitrate to obtain a premium price \ncompared to substitute commodity fertilizers such as potassium chloride and potassium sulfate.  \nIn 2023, revenues from sales of specialty plant nutrients declined to US$913.9 million, representing \n12.2% of our total revenues for that year and a 22% drop in sales compared to the US$1,172.3 million  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 88 observed in 2022. In 2023, average prices in this business segment fell by approximately 21.3% \ncompared to 2022.  \nWe believe we are the largest producer of potassium nitrate in the world. We estimate that our sales \nvolume represented approximately 42% of the total potassium nitrate traded in the world for agricultural \nuse during 2023.  \nThe following table shows total production and sales volumes and ordinary revenues for specialty plant \nnutrients for 2023, 2022 and 2021 :\nSpecialty Plant Nutrition (SPN)  2023  2022  2021  \nProduction volumes (thousands of metric tons)  861,3  925,3  1.208,2  \nSodium nitrate  17,1 18,4 50,2 \nPotassium nitrate and potassium sodium nitrate  464,3  550,9  679,1  \nSpecialty blends (1) 243,4  217,9  304,0  \nBlended nutrients and other specialty plant nutrients (2) 136,5  138,1  174,9  \nSales volumes (thousands of metric tons)  840,2  847,9  1.154,6  \nSodium nitrate  16,7 14,4 32,1 \nPotassium nitrate and potassium sodium nitrate  443,5  477,4  643,6  \nSpecialty blends (1) 243 218 304 \nBlended nutrients and other specialty plant nutrients (2) 136,5  138,1  174,9  \nRevenues (in millions of US$)  \n(1) Includes products from third parties in accordance with our \ncommercial agreement  \n(2) Includes products from third parties in accordance with our \ncommercial agreement  \n(3) Includes trading of other specialty fertilizers  \n 913,9  1.172,3  908,8   6 OUR BUSINESS     89 Specialty Plant Nutrition: Market  \nThe target market for specialty plant nutrients is farmers producing high -value crops such as vegetables, \nfruits, industrial crops, flowers, cotton and others. Since 1990, the international market for specialty plant \nnutrients has grown at a faster rate th an the international market for commodity fertilizers. This is mainly \ndue to: (i) the application of new agricultural technologies such as fertigation, hydroponics and \ngreenhouses; (ii) increasing land costs and water scarcity, which have forced farmers to  improve yields \nand reduce water use; and (iii) increased demand for higher quality crops.  \nAs an exception, during 2022 and 2023 and due to the sharp increase in price, adverse weather events \nand high inflation, the agricultural soluble potassium nitrate market had a reduction in consumption of \napproximately 10% and 15%, respectively. These esti mates do not consider potassium nitrate produced \nand sold locally in China, and only include net imports and exports.  \nSpecialty Plant Nutrition: Products  \nWe produce three main types of specialty plant nutrients that provide nutritional solutions for fertigation, \ndirect soil applications and foliar fertilizers: potassium nitrate (KNO 3 ), sodium nitrate (NaNO 3 ) and \nspecialty blends. We also sell other specialty fertilizers, including products produced by third parties. \nAll of these products are used in solid or liquid form primarily on high -value crops such as fruits, flowers \nand some vegetables. These fertili zers are widely used in crops using modern agricultural techniques \nsuch as hydroponics, greenhouses and crops with foliar application and fertigation (in the latter case, the \nfertilizer is dissolved in water prior to irrigation).  \nSpecialty plant nutrients have certain advantages over commercial fertilizers, such as fast and effective \nabsorption (without requiring nitrification), superior water solubility, and low chloride content. One of \nthe most important products in this business  line is potassium nitrate, which is marketed in crystalline or \nprilled form, allowing for different application methods. Crystalline potassium nitrate products are ideal \nfor fertigation and foliar applications, and potassium nitrate beads are suitable for  direct soil applications.  \nSpecial blends are produced using our own special plant nutrients and other components in blending \nplants operated by us or our affiliates and related companies around the world.  \nThe advantages of our special \"Ultrasol\" vegetable blends include the following:  \n• They are totally water soluble, which allows their more efficient use in hydroponics, fertigation, \nfoliar applications  and other advanced agricultural techniques, thus reducing water use.  \n• They are chloride -free, which prevents toxicity in certain chloride -sensitive crops.  \n• Provide nitrogen in nitric form, thus allowing crops to absorb nutrients faster than urea or \nammonium based fertilizers;  \n \nWe have developed brands for their commercialization according to the different applications and uses \nof our products. Our main brands are: Ultrasol® (fertigation), Qrop® (soil application), Speedfol® \n(foliar application) and Allganic® (organic agriculture ). \nDuring 2023, we continued to grow sales of differentiated fertilizers such as Ultrasoline® for improved \nroot growth and optimal nitrogen metabolism, ProP® for more efficient phosphorus absorption, and \nProhydric® for more efficient fertilization and water u se. \n \n  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 90 Specialty Plant Nutrition: Marketing and Customers  \nIn 2023, the Company sold its specialty plant nutrients in approximately 93 countries and more than \n1,100 customers. A single customer individually accounted for at least 10% of this segment's sales during \n2023, representing approximately 12.6% of NVE's re venues. The 10 largest customers collectively \naccounted for approximately 39% of sales during that period. No single supplier accounted for more than \n10% of this business line's cost of sales.  \nThe following table shows the geographic breakdown of sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \nBreakdown of EVN sales  2023  2022  2021  \nNorth America................  45% 42% 35% \nEurope........................  14% 16% 20% \nChile............................  12% 11% 15% \nCentral and South America.............  8% 11% 10% \nAsia and Others.................  21% 20% 21% \nThese products are sold through a worldwide network of sales offices and distributors.  \nWe maintain an inventory of our specialty plant nutrients in our commercial offices in our principal \nmarkets to facilitate prompt deliveries to customers. Sales are made pursuant to spot purchase orders or \nshort -term contracts.  \nAs part of our marketing strategy, we provide technical and agronomic assistance to our customers. We \nhave specific knowledge resulting from extensive research and numerous studies conducted by our \nagronomic teams in close contact with growers around the w orld. Strong agronomic knowledge is key \nto the development of specific formulas and hydroponic and fertigation nutritional plans, allowing us to \nprovide expert advice.  \nBy working closely with our customers, we are able to identify their needs for new products and possible \nhigher value -added markets. Our specialty plant nutrients are used in a wide variety of crops, particularly \nhigh-value crops, where the use of our prod ucts enables our customers to increase yields and quality to \nachieve a premium price for their products.  \nOur customers are located in various latitudes. Consequently, we do not believe there are seasonal or \ncyclical factors that could materially affect sales of our specialty plant nutrients.  \nSpecialty Plant Nutrition: Competition  \nThe main competitive factors in potassium nitrate sales are product quality, customer service, location, \nlogistics, agronomic support and price.  \nWe believe we are the largest producer of potassium nitrate for agricultural use in the world. Potassium \nnitrate products compete indirectly with specialty substitutes and other commodities , which may be used \nby some customers in place of potassium nitrate, depending on the type of soil and crop to which the \nproduct will be applied.  \nOur sales represented approximately 42% of global agricultural potassium nitrate sales by volume during \n2023. In the market for 100% soluble potassium nitrate, our main competitor is Haifa Chemicals Ltd. \nWe estimate that Haifa's sales of agricultural potas sium nitrate accounted for approximately 20% of total  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 91 worldwide sales during 2023 (excluding sales by Chinese producers to the Chinese domestic market). \nKemapco, a Jordanian producer owned by Arab Potash, produces potassium nitrate at a plant located \nnear the port of Aqaba, Jordan. We estimate that sales of a gricultural potassium nitrate by Kemapco \naccounted for approximately 11% of total global sales during 2023.  \nACF, another Chilean producer, mainly oriented to iodine production, has been producing potassium \nnitrate from caliche ore and potassium chloride since 2005. In addition, there are several potassium \nnitrate producers in China.  \nIodine and derivatives\nWe believe we are the largest producer of iodine in the world. In 2023, iodine and iodine derivatives \nrevenues reached approximately US$892.2 million, representing 11.9% of total revenues in that year and \nan increase from the US$754.3 million observed in 2 022. This increase was mainly attributable to \nslightly higher sales volumes and higher average prices during 2023. Average iodine prices were \napproximately 15.2% higher in 2023 than in 2022. Our sales volumes increased by approximately 2.7% \nin 2023. We est imate that our sales represented approximately 35% of worldwide iodine sales by volume \nin 2023.  \nThe following table presents total production and sales volumes and revenues for iodine and its \nderivatives for 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \nIodine and derivatives  2023  2022  2021  \nProduction volume (thousands of metric tons)  13,9 12,4 10,3 \nSales volume (thousands of metric tons)  13,1 12,7 12,3 \nRevenues (in millions of US$)  892,2  754,3  437,9  \nIodine: Market  \nIodine and its derivatives are used in a wide range of medical, agricultural and industrial applications, as \nwell as in human and animal nutrition products. Iodine and its derivatives are used as raw materials or \ncatalysts in the formulation of products such as X -ray contrast media, biocides, antiseptics and \ndisinfectants, pharmaceutical intermediates, polarizing films for LCD and LED screens, chemicals, \norgan ic compounds and pigments. Iodine in the form of potassium iodate or potassium iodide is also \nadded  to edible salt to prevent iodine deficiency disorders.  \nIn 2023, we believe the market experienced a decline of approximately 4% compared to the prior year. \nThis decline can be attributed primarily to a number of key factors affecting various industries. Initially, \nthe broader economic slowdown played a key rol e in shaping this trend, affected industrial production \nand led companies to adjust their storage policies to adapt to changing market conditions. Next, the \nintroduction of new regulations emerged as another critical factor, which significantly influenced the \nreduction of iodine demand in the fluorochemical industry. Finally, the impact of high iodine prices \nmarked a decisive factor, prompting two main responses: substitution, with customers migrating to \nalternative products, and reformulation, where produc t compositions were adjusted to minimize iodine \ncontent. Taken together, each of these elements has played a unique role in the observed decline in iodine \ndemand throughout the year.  \nIn contrast, demand for X -ray contrast media emerged as the main driver of growth in the iodine market. \nThis increase is largely due to rising healthcare expenditure and improved access to medical services in  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 92 emerging economies. The increasing use of diagnostic imaging, particularly in these regions, has \nsignificantly boosted demand for iodine -based contrast agents, offsetting some of the declines seen in \nother sectors.  \nThe following graph shows the distribution of iodine demand by various applications in 2023.\nMedios de contraste \nRayos -X\n34%\nFarmacéuticos\n14%Películas \npolarizantes \n(LCD y LED)\n12%Yodósforos y \npovidona yodada\n7%Nutrición animal\n7%Fluroderivados\n7%Biocidas\n5%Nutrición humana\n3%Nailon\n3%Otros\n8%Distribution of iodine demand in 2023 \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 93 Iodine: Products  \nWe produce iodine at our Nueva Victoria plant near Iquique, Chile, at the Pedro de Valdivia plant and at \nour newest addition, the Pampa Blanca mine site, both located near Maria Elena, Chile. We have a total \nannual production capacity of approximately 14,3 00 metric tons of iodine.  \nWe also, through the Ajay -SQM Group (\"ASG\"), produce organic and inorganic iodine derivatives. ASG \nwas founded in the mid -1990s and has production facilities in the United States, Chile and France. ASG is \none of the world's leading producers of organic and  inorganic iodine derivatives.  \nIn line with our iodine business strategy, we are constantly working on the development of new applications \nfor our iodine -based products, aiming at a continuous expansion of our business and maintaining our market \nleadership.  \nWe manufacture our iodine and iodine derivatives in accordance with international quality standards and \nhave qualified our iodine production facilities and processes under ISO 9001:2015, providing third -party \ncertification of the quality management system and international quality control standards we have \nimplemented.  \nIodine: Marketing and Customers  \nIn 2023, SQM sold its iodine products in approximately 30 countries to approximately 158 customers, and \nmost of these sales were exports. A single customer individually accounted for more than 10% of sales in \nthis segment, representing approximately 22.8% of iodine sales. The 10 largest customers together \naccounted for approximately 68% of sales during this period. On the other hand, no supplier had an \nindividual concentration of at least 10% of the cost of sales of this line of business.  \nThe following table shows the geographic breakdown of our sales:  \nBreakdown of sales of iodine and \nderivatives  2023  2022  2021  \nNorth America...................  14% 19% 23% \nEurope...........................  41% 38% 40% \nChile............................  0% 0% 0% \nCentral and South America......   2% 2% 2% \nAsia and Others.................  42% 41% 34% \nThe Company sells iodine through its own worldwide network of representative offices and through sales, \nsupport and distribution affiliates. The Company also maintains iodine inventories at its facilities \nthroughout the world to facilitate prompt delivery to customers. Iodine sales are made pursuant to spot \npurchase orders or within the framework of supply contracts. The contracts generally specify minimum and \nmaximum purchase commitments and prices are adjusted periodically in accordance with prevailing ma rket \nprices.  \nIodine: Competition  \nThe largest iodine producers are located in Chile, Japan and the United States. There is also iodine \nproduction in Russia, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Indonesia and China.  \nIn Chile, iodine is produced from a mineral that is unique in the world: caliche, while in Japan, the United \nStates, Russia, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia producers extract iodine from subway brines, \nwhich are obtained in conjunction with the extr action of natural gas and oil. In China, iodine is extracted \nfrom seaweed.  \nFive Chilean companies accounted for approximately 57% of total global iodine sales in 2023, including \nSQM, with approximately 35%, and four other producers accounted for the remaining 22%. The other  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 94 Chilean producers are Atacama Chemical S.A.C. (Cosayach), controlled by the Chilean holding company \nInverraz S.A.; ACF Minera S.A., owned by the Chilean Urruticoechea family; Algorta Norte S.A., a joint \nventure between ACF Minera S.A. and Toyota Tsusho; and Atacama Minerals, ow ned by the Chinese \ncompany Tewoo.  \nWe estimate that eight Japanese iodine producers accounted for approximately 27% of global iodine sales \nin 2023, including recycled iodine.  \nWe estimate that iodine producers in the United States accounted for nearly 5% of global iodine sales in \n2023.  \nIodine recycling is a growing trend worldwide. Several producers have recycling facilities where they \nrecover iodine and iodine derivatives from iodine waste streams.  \nWe estimate that 17% of our iodine supply comes from iodine recycling. Through ASG or alone, we also \nactively participate in the iodine recycling business using iodine by -product streams from a variety of \nchemical processes in Europe and the United States.  \nPrices of iodine and iodine products are determined by market conditions. World iodine prices vary \ndepending on, among other things, the relationship between supply and demand at any given time. The \nsupply of iodine varies primarily as a result of the prod uction levels of iodine producers (including us) and \ntheir respective commercial strategies.  \nOur average annual selling prices for iodine increased to approximately US$68 per kilogram in 2023 from \nthe average selling prices of approximately US$59 per kilogram observed in 2022.  \nThe demand for iodine varies according to the general levels of economic activity and the level of demand \nin the medical, pharmaceutical, industrial and other sectors that are the main users of iodine and iodine -\nderived products. Certain iodine substitutes  are available for certain applications, such as antiseptics and \ndisinfectants, which could represent a cost -effective alternative to iodine depending on prevailing prices.  \nThe principal competitive factors in the sale of iodine and iodine products are reliability, price, quality, \ncustomer service and price and availability of substitutes. We believe that we have competitive advantages \nover other producers due to the size and  quality of our mining reserves and available production capacity. \nWe believe that our iodine is competitive with that produced by other manufacturers in certain advanced \nindustrial processes. We also believe that we benefit competitively from the long -term relationships we \nhave established with our major customers s.  \nLithium and derivatives  \nIn 2023, our lithium sales revenues totaled US$5,180.1 million, representing 69.4% and a 36.5% decrease \nfrom the US$8,152.9 million observed in 2022 due to lower average realized prices, partially offset by \nhigher sales volumes during the year. The average  price for lithium and lithium derivatives for 2023 was \n41.4% lower than the average price seen in 2022. Our total sales volumes grew by approximately 8.4% in \n2023.  \nWe believe we are one of the world's largest producers of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide and \nestimate that our sales represented approximately 18% of worldwide lithium chemical sales in terms of \nvolume.  \nThe following table shows total production and sales volumes and revenues for lithium and lithium \nderivatives for 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \n \n \n  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 95  \n \n \n \n1 Includes lithium carbonate production volumes in Chile and lithium hydroxide (from lithium sulfate) in China.  \nLithium: Market  \nThe lithium market can be divided into (i) direct use lithium minerals, in which SQM does not participate, \n(ii) basic lithium chemicals, which include lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and lithium chloride, and \n(iii) inorganic and organic lithium deriva tives, which include numerous compounds produced from basic \nlithium chemicals, a market in which SQM also does not participate directly.  \nLithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide are used for the production of cathode material for secondary \n(rechargeable) batteries, due to the high electrochemical potential and low density of lithium. Batteries \nrepresent the main application for lithium, with  approximately 90% of total demand, including batteries for \nelectric vehicles, which represent approximately 70% of total demand.  \nThere are many other applications for both basic lithium chemicals and lithium derivatives, such as \nlubricating greases for heat -resistant glass (ceramic glass), chips for the ceramic and glazing industry, air -\nconditioning chemicals, as well as other pharm aceutical syntheses and metal alloys.  \nThe main properties of lithium, which facilitate its use in this range of applications, are that:  \n• is the lightest solid metal and element at room temperature;  \n• is of low density;  \n• has a low coefficient of thermal expansion;  \n• has a high electrochemical potential; and  \n• It has a high specific heat capacity.  \nDuring 2023, demand for lithium chemicals increased by approximately 18%, reaching approximately \n920,000 metric tons. We expect energy storage -related applications to continue to drive demand in the \ncoming years.  \nLithium: Products  \nWe produce lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) at our Lithium Chemical Plant \nnear Antofagasta, Chile, from highly concentrated lithium chloride produced in the Salar de Atacama. The \nannual production capacity of our lithium carbonate plant is now 200,000 metric tons per year. We are in \nthe process of increasing our production capacity to 210,000 metric tons per year by the end of 2024. We \nbelieve that the technologies we use, together with the high concentrations of lithium and the cha racteristics \nof the Salar de Atacama, such as the high evaporation rate and concentration of other minerals, allow us to \nbe one of the lowest cost lithium producers worldwide.  \nThe lithium hydroxide facility has a production capacity of 30,000 metric tons per year and we are in the \nprocess of increasing this production capacity to 100,000 metric tons per year by 2025.  \nAlso, during 2023, we produced lithium hydroxide in China from lithium sulfate extracted from the Salar \nde Atacama salt flats and transported to our lithium refining plant located in Sichuan province, which has \na capacity of 20,000 metric tons of lithium h ydroxide per year. In addition, we are developing the Mt. \nHolland lithium project in Australia through our joint venture with Wesfarmers, which we expect to have \na total production capacity of 50,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide when completed.  \nLithium: Marketing and Customers  \nIn 2023, we sold our lithium products in approximately 39 countries to approximately 207 customers, with \nthe majority of our sales to customers outside Chile. During 2023, 92% of our lithium sales were made in Lithium and Derivatives  2023  2022  2021  \nProduction volume (thousands of metric tons)1 165,5  152,9  108,4  \nSales volume (thousands of metric tons)  170,0  156,8  101,1  \nRevenues (in millions of US$)  5.180,1  8.152,9  936,1   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 96 Asia. Two customers accounted for at least 10% of lithium and lithium derivatives sales each, representing \napproximately 21.8% of our lithium revenues in 2023. Our ten largest customers together accounted for \napproximately 67% of revenues. One supplier, Co rfo, accounted for approximately 62% of this business \nline's cost of sales, mainly related to lease payments payable to Corfo under the Corfo Agreements for \nlithium products produced in the Salar de Atacama. We make lease payments to Corfo which are associ ated \nwith the sale of different products produced in the Salar de Atacama, including lithium carbonate, lithium \nhydroxide and potassium chloride. See Note 22.2 to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure of \nlease payments made to Corfo for all periods presented.  \nThe following table shows the geographic breakdown of our sales for 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe sell lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide through our own worldwide network of representative \noffices and through our sales, support and distribution affiliates. We maintain stocks of these products in \nour facilities around the world to facilitate pr ompt delivery to customers. Sales of lithium carbonate and \nlithium hydroxide are made on the basis of spot purchase orders or under supply contracts. The contracts \ngenerally specify minimum and maximum annual purchase commitments, and prices are adjusted \nperiodically, according to the variation of price indexes established in the market.  \n Lithium: Competition  \nLithium is obtained mainly from two sources: (i) continental brines and (ii) ores. During 2023, the main \nlithium producing countries from brines were Chile, Argentina and China, while from ores were Australia \nand also China. Other relevant countries in lit hium production are Brazil and Zimbabwe. With total sales \nof approximately 170,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, we believe our market \nshare was 18% in 2023. The main competitors in the lithium market with their estimated market s hare \npercentage are: Albemarle (17%), Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co (8%), Tianqi Lithium Corp (7%), Allkem \n(4%) and Arcadium Lithium Corp (4%).  \nTianqi is also a significant shareholder of SQM, holding approximately 22.16% of the shares as of \nDecember 31, 2023.  \nWe believe that lithium production will continue to increase this decade in response to an increase in \ndemand growth. Several new projects to develop lithium deposits have recently been announced. Some of \nthese projects are already in advanced stages of de velopment and others could materialize in the medium \nterm.  \nPotassium  \nIn 2023, the Company's potassium chloride and potassium sulfate revenues totaled US$279.1 million, \nrepresenting 3.7% of total revenues and a decrease of 36.2% compared to 2022 due to significantly lower \nprices, partially offset by higher sales volumes duri ng the year. The average price for 2023 was \napproximately 43.5% lower than average prices in 2022. Our sales volumes in 2023 were approximately \n13.0% higher than the sales volumes reported during 2022.  \nWe estimate that we will account for less than 1% of global potassium chloride sales in 2023.

We estimate global demand in 2023 to \nreach approximately 66 million metric tons, an increase from the 60 million metric ton s seen in 2022, \nprimarily as a result of lower price and higher availability of potash supply, sourced mainly from Belarus.  \nAccording to studies prepared by the International Fertilizer Industry Association, cereals account for \napproximately 45% of global potassium demand, including corn (14%), rice (12%), wheat (16%), soybeans \n(9%) and sugar (2). Other uses account for about 4 7%. \nThe following graph represents the distribution of potassium demand by crop type in 2023:  \n \nPotassium: Product  \nWe produce potassium chloride (KCl) and potassium sulfate (K 2 SO 4 ) from the extraction of brines from \nthe Salar de Atacama rich in potassium and other salts.  \nPotassium chloride is the most widely used and least expensive fertilizer for the application of potassium \nto different crops. We offer potassium chloride in two grades: standard and compacted. Potassium is one \nof the three macronutrients a plant needs to develop. It is used to fertilize crops that can tolerate relatively \nhigh levels of chloride and to fertilize crops grown under conditions with sufficient rainfall or irrigation \npractices that prevent chloride from accumulating to excessive levels in the pl ant's root systems.  \nSome benefits that can be obtained through the use of potassium are:  \n• higher performance and quality;  \n• increased protein production;  \n• increased photosynthesis;  \n• improvement of water efficiency.

No single customer \nindividually accounted for at least 10% of this segment's sales in 2023. We estimate that the 10 largest \ncustomers together accounted for approximately 43% of sales during this period . No single supplier has a \nconcentration of at least 10% of the cost of sales of this line of business. We make lease payments to Corfo \nthat are associated with the sale of different products produced in the Salar de Atacama, in cluding lithium \ncarbonate, lithium hydroxide and potassium chloride. See Note 22.2 to our consolidated financial \nstatements for disclosure of lease payments made to Corfo for all periods presented.  \nThe following table shows the geographic breakdown of sales for 2022, 2021 and 2020:  \nSales breakdown Potassium  2023  2022  2021  \nNorth America................  24% 16% 14% \nEurope........................  11% 6% 8% \nChile............................  11% 15% 12% \nCentral and South America.............  34% 41% 51% \nAsia and Others.................  20% 22% 14% \nPotassium: Competition  \nWe estimate that we will account for approximately 1% of global potassium chloride sales in 2023. Our \nmain competitors are Nutrien, Uralkali, Belaruskali and Mosaic. We estimate that in 2023 the competition \nreached (in approximate figures) the following ma rket share: Nutrien 21% of global sales, Uralkali 15% of \nglobal sales, Mosaic 13% of global sales and Belaruskali 10% of global sales.  \nIndustrial Chemicals  \nIn 2023, revenues from industrial chemicals totaled US$175.2 million, representing 2.3% of our total \nrevenues for that year, and an increase of 6.1% from the US$165.2 million observed in 2022 as a result of \nhigher sales volumes in this business line, which  offset lower sales prices. Sales volumes in 2023 increased \n22.8% from the sales volumes reported in the previous year, while average prices in the business line \ndecreased 13.6% during 2023 from the average prices reported during 2022.  \nThe following table presents total production and sales volumes and total revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \nIndustrial chemicals  2023   2022   2021  \nProduction volume (in thousands of metric tons)  160,4   156,0   97,9 \nSales volume (in thousands of metric tons)  180,4   147,0   174,5  \nTotal revenues (US$ millions)  175,2   165,2   132,0  \nNote: The level of activity of intermediate products is reported as production.  \nIndustrial Chemicals: Market  \nIndustrial sodium and potassium nitrates are used in a wide range of industrial applications, including glass, \nceramics and explosives production, metal recycling, insulation materials, metal treatment, solar thermal \nenergy and various chemical processes.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 99 We are also experiencing growing interest in the use of solar salts in non -CSP ( Concentrated Solar Power ) \nthermal storage solutions. Due to their proven performance, solar salts are being tested in industrial process \nheat and waste heat solutions. These new applications may open up new opportunities for the use of solar \nsalts in the near future, such as the retrofitting of coal -fired plants.  \nIndustrial Chemicals: Products  \nIn this business line we produce and market three industrial chemicals: sodium nitrate (NaNO 3 ), potassium \nnitrate (KNO 3 ) and potassium chloride (KCl) in industrial grades. Sodium nitrate is mainly used in the \nproduction of glass and explosives, metal processing, metal recycling and production of insulating \nmaterials, adhesives, among others. Potassium nitrate is used as a  raw material for the production of frits \nfor ceramic and metallic surfaces, in the production of special glass, in the enamel industry,  metal treatment \nand pyrotechnics. Solar salts, which are a combination of potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate, are used as \na thermal storage medium in solar power generation plants. Potassium chloride is used as an additive in oil \ndrilling, as well as in  food processing, among others.  \nSQM enjoys certain operational flexibility in producing industrial nitrates, since they are produced from \nthe same process as its equivalent grade for agricultural use, requiring only an additional purification step. \nIt is feasible, with certain restrictio ns, to switch production from one grade to another depending on market \nconditions. This flexibility allows maximizing yields as well as reducing commercial risk. The Company \nalso produces and markets potassium chloride for industrial applications.  \nIndustrial Chemicals: Marketing and Customers  \nIn 2023, we sold our industrial nitrates products to approximately 297 customers in 52 countries. One \ncustomer accounted for at least 10% of this segment's sales, representing 40.5% of sales, and the 10 largest \ncustomers together accounted for approximatel y 61% of this segment's revenues. On the other hand, no \nsupplier has an individual concentration of less than 10% of the cost of sales of this line of business. We \nmake lease payments to Corfo associated with the sale of different products produced in the Salar de \nAtacama, including lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and potassium chloride. See Note 22.2 to our \nconsolidated financial statements for disclosure of lease payments made to Corfo for all periods presented.  \nThe following table shows the geographic breakdown of our sales for 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \nBreakdown of sales  2023  2022  2021  \nNorth America ...................  27% 36% 23% \nEurope...........................  12% 17% 14% \nChile...........................  1% 1% 3% \nCentral and South America..........   6% 7% 6% \nAsia and Others....................  54% 39% 55% \nSQM sells its industrial chemicals mainly through its own network of offices, logistics platforms, \nrepresentatives and distributors. As with the other products in the portfolio, inventories of the different \ngrades of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate ar e maintained to facilitate prompt deliveries to customers. \nWe also provide them with support and work with them to improve the service and quality of SQM \nproducts, developing new uses and applications for them.  \nIndustrial Chemicals: Competence  \nWe believe we are one of the world's largest producers of industrial sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate. \nIn 2023, our estimated market share by volume for industrial potassium nitrate was 62% and for industrial \nsodium nitrate was 44% (excluding domestic demand in China and India).  \nIn the refined -grade sodium nitrate market, the main competitors are BASF AG, a German company, and \nseveral producers in China and Eastern Europe. All of them are highly competitive and produce synthetic  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 100 sodium nitrate as a by -product of other chemical production processes. SQM's industrial sodium nitrate \nproducts also compete indirectly with substitute chemicals, including sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, \ncalcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, which can b e used in certain applications in place of sodium nitrate \nand sold by a large number of producers worldwide.\nThe main competitors in the industrial potassium nitrate business are Haifa Chemicals (with 8% market \nshare in 2023), Kemapco (accounting for 4% of global sales) and some Chinese producers (with 7% market \nshare in 2023).  \nProducers compete in the sodium nitrate and industrial potassium nitrate market on the basis of reliability, \nproduct quality, price and customer service. SQM believes it is a low -cost producer of both products and \nhas the ability to produce high quality pr oducts with local presence and expertise.  \nOther Products and Services  \nSQM receives revenues from the commercialization of third -party fertilizers (specialty and commodity ).  \nThese fertilizers are marketed in large volumes around the world and are used as raw materials for specialty \nblends or to complement the product portfolio. We have developed trade administration, supply, flexibility \nand inventory management capabilitie s that have enabled us to adapt to the volatile fertilizer market and \nprofit from these transactions.  \nRevenues from sales of other commodity fertilizers and other income reached US$27.0 million for the \ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023, lower than the US$28.6 million recorded during the same period \nof 2022.  \nNew Business  \nWe constantly evaluate opportunities that are consistent with our existing and new businesses. We seek to \nacquire interests in projects both inside and outside Chile where we believe we have sustainable competitive \nadvantages, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.  \nIn Australia, in addition to Mt. Holland and our investment in Azure Minerals, we are conducting early -\nstage exploration activities on a number of different projects. Some of these activities are carried out \ndirectly by our in -house geological exploration team, based in our Perth, Western Australia office, and \nothers are worked in conjunction with partners through participation agreements. Activities range from \noffice -based target generation to in -situ mapping, rock/soil chip sampling and drilling.  \nIn Chile, we are actively exploring for metallic minerals on mineral properties we own. If such minerals \nare found, we may decide to mine them, sell them or form a joint venture to extract these resources. Our \nexploration efforts are currently focused on t he bedrock layer that underlies the caliche ore that we use as \na primary raw material in the production of iodine and nitrates. This bedrock has significant potential for \nmetal mineralization, particularly copper, gold and silver. A significant portion of our mining properties \nare located in the Antofagasta region of Chile, where many large copper producers operate.  \nWe have an in -house geological exploration team that explores the area directly, identifying drill targets \nand evaluating new prospects. In 2021, the team confirmed the existence of high -grade copper and gold \nmineralization at the Búfalo project, located 1 20 kilometers east of the city of Antofagasta. The Búfalo \nproject corresponds to a district that hosts several copper, copper -gold and copper -gold-silver mineralized \nbodies in which SQM has already drilled close to 156,000 meters, using our own diamond and  Reverse \nCirculation drilling machines. We have also generated more than 45 projects with copper potential, in \ngreenfield and intermediate exploration stages, which will be drilled starting in 2024. We also have a metals \nbusiness development team working to engage partners interested in investing in metals exploration within \nour mining properties. As of December 2023, we had two option agreements in place with three mining \ncompanies and private equity firms. We participated in the formation of a joint ventu re as a result of the \nexercise of an option agreement with a junior mining company.  \n \n  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 101 Research and Development, Patents and Licenses  \nOne of the main objectives of our team is innovation through research and development to develop new \nprocesses and products in order to maximize the yield obtained from the resources we exploit. Our research \nis carried out through three different units, wh ose research lines cover topics such as design, modeling and \nsimulation of chemical processes for the optimization of existing products or development of new products.  \nOur research and development policy emphasizes the following: (i) optimizing current processes to reduce \ncosts and improve product quality by implementing new technology, (ii) developing higher margin \nproducts from current products through vertical integra tion or different product specifications, (iii) adding \nvalue to inventories, and (iv) using renewable energy in our processes.  \nOur research and development activities have been instrumental in improving our production processes and \ndeveloping new value -added products. As a result, new extraction, crystallization and product finishing \nmethods have been developed. Technological adva nces in recent years have enabled us to improve process \nefficiency for nitrate, potassium and lithium operations, improve the physical quality of our prilled products \nand reduce dust emissions and caking through the application of specially designed additi ves to our bulk -\nhandled products. Our research and development efforts have also resulted in new value -added markets for \nour products. One example is the use of potassium sulfate for the production of lithium hydroxide and the \nuse of sodium nitrate and pot assium nitrate as thermal storage in solar power plants.  \nDuring 2023, innovation occurred in the context of conceptual and laboratory development of twenty new \ntechnologies for the Salar Futuro Project in the Salar de Atacama and the pilot -scale development of four \nDirect Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies. F or the year 2023, the Company executed a research and \ndevelopment budget of US$7.5 million for the nitrates and iodine business and US$33 million for the \nlithium business.  \nThe Company has patented several production processes for nitrate, iodine and lithium products. These \npatents have been registered mainly in the United States of America, Chile and other countries, when \nnecessary. The patents used in SQM's production proce sses are Chilean Patent No. 47,080 for iodine \n(production of spherical shaped granules for subliming products) and Japanese Patent No. 4,889,848 for \nnitrates (granular fertilizers).  \nAll factors relevant to business development are described in Section 3.6 Risk Management.  \n6.3 STAKEHOLDERS  \nThe Company has identified its stakeholders based on four factors that affect its relationship with them: \nneeds, impacts, interests and expectations.  \nThis process is validated by the Board of Directors, which considers the expectations of stakeholders \nthrough a permanent supervision of the commitments established with them, within the framework of the \nCorporate Governance Policy and the Sustainability, Ethics and Human Rights Policy. The main objective \nof this work is to create and strengthen long -term bonds of  trust, since they are fundamental actors of the \nCompany's activities.  \nThe stakeholders identified by SQM and the reasons for their importance are as follows:  \nEmployees: They are strategic allies of the Company's Mission and Purpose and, therefore, contribute \ndirectly to the fulfillment of the priority focuses of the business, through their talent, good performance and \nsense of belonging to the organization.  \nShareholders / Investors : Shareholders make SQM's business strategy a reality by providing capital and \npermanently monitoring the progress of the business.

These \nrequirements differ significantly from the previously applicable disclosure requirements of SEC Industry \nGuide 7. Among other differences, Regulation SK -1300 requires disclosure of mineral resources, in \naddition to mineral reserves, as of December 31, 2023, both in the aggregate and for each of our individual \nmaterial mineral properties. Our mineral reserves and mineral resources are estimated by individuals \ndeemed to be Competent Persons (CPs) in accordance  with the standards set forth in Regulation SK -1300.  \nSQM believes it is a production -stage company based on the classification of its material properties. SQM \nreports mineral resource and reserve estimates for development and production stage projects based on \nSQM's classification of its material properties. See the individual property disclosures below for more \ndetails on mineral rights, titles, property size, permits and other information on our significant mineral \nproperties.  \nMineral resources and reserves are defined in Regulation SK -1300 as follows:  \nMineral Resource : A concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the earth's crust \nin such form, grade or quality, and quantity, that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A \nmineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralizati on, taking into account relevant factors such as \ncut-off grade, probable dimensions of extraction, location or continuity that, under assumed and justifiable \ntechnical and economic conditions, is likely, in whole or in part, to become eco nomically extractable. It is \nnot simply an inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled.  \nMineral Reserve: An estimate of tonnage and grade, or quality of indicated and measured mineral \nresources that, in the opinion of the Qualified Person, may form the basis of an economically viable project. \nMore specifically, it is the economically mineable portion of a mea sured or indicated mineral resource, \nwhich includes dilution materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.  \nUnder SK -1300, mineral resources cannot be classified as mineral reserves unless a qualified person has \ndetermined that such mineral resources can form the basis of an economically viable project. Conversion \nof reported mineral resources to mineral reserve s should not be assumed.  \nMineral resource classifications are differentiated in Regulation SK -1300, in part, as follows:  \nMeasured Resource: That part of a Mineral Resource with the highest level of geological confidence; the \nquantity and grade, or quality, are estimated on the basis of geological testing and conclusive sampling. \nThe level of geological certainty associated with a Measured Mine ral Resource is sufficient to allow a \nqualified person to apply modification factors in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and \nfinal assessment of the economic viability of the deposit.  \nIndicated Resource: That part of a mineral resource with a level of geological confidence between the \nmeasured and inferred resource level; the quantity and grade, or quality, are estimated on the basis of \nappropriate geological testing and sampling. The level of geological c ertainty associated with an indicated \nmineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modification factors in sufficient detail \nto support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  \nInferred resource: That part of a mineral resource with the lowest level of geological confidence; the \nquantity and grade, or quality, are estimated on the basis of limited geological testing and sampling. The \nlevel of geological uncertainty associated with an Inferred Miner al Resource is too high to apply relevant \ntechnical and economic factors that may influence the prospects for economic extraction in a manner useful \nfor the assessment of economic viability.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 106 Production Process  \nOur integrated production process can be classified according to our natural resources:  \n• caliche deposits, which contain nitrates, iodine and potassium;  \n• brines from the Salar de Atacama, which contain potassium, lithium, sulfate, boron and \nmagnesium; and  \n• spodumene deposits of the Mt. Holland project in Western Australia, which contain lithium.  \n \nCaliche  \nQualified geologists and mining engineers prepare our caliche resource and reserve estimates. The resource \nand reserve figures presented below are estimates and may be subject to change due to natural factors \naffecting the distribution of ore grades, which, in turn, would change nitrate and iodine recoveries. \nTherefore, there can be no guarantee that the indicated levels of nitrate and iodine recovery will be \nachieved.  \nWe estimate mineral resources and reserves based on evaluations by engineers and geologists of assay \nvalues derived from sampling of drill holes and other openings. Drilling has been carried out at different \nspacing intervals in order to recognize mineral resources. Typically, we start with 400x400 meters and then \nreduce the spacing to 200x200 meters, 100x100 meters, 100T(~100 x 50 meters), 50x50 meters. The \ngeological occurrence of caliche ore is unique and different from other metallic and non -metallic mi nerals. \nCaliche occurs in large horizontal layers at depths ranging from one to four meters and has an overburden \nof between zero and two meters. This horizontal layering is a natural geological condition and allows us to \nestimate the continuity of the cal iche bed based on surface geological reconnaissance and analysis of \nsamples and trenches.  \nSalar de Atacama Brines  \nQualified hydrogeologists and geologists prepare our resource estimates and reserve base of potassium, \nsulfate, lithium and boron dissolved in brines in the Salar de Atacama. We have exploitation concessions \nthrough leases with Corfo with an area of 81,920  hectares, in which we have carried out geological \nexploitation, brine sampling and geostatistical analysis.  \nMt. Holland spodumene  \nGeologists and mining engineers who are qualified persons in accordance with SK -1300 regulations \nprepared the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate for the lithium -rich minerals contained in \npegmatites at the Mt. Holland deposit. The mineral reserv e has been calculated from the mine plan, created \nfrom the mineral resource estimate. The three dimensional solids used to define the geological domains are \nconstructed by style of mineralization and are based on a 0.5% lithium oxide cut -off grade.  \nMining rights  \nThe discussion of our mineral rights is organized below according to the geographic location of our mining \noperations. Our caliche mining interests are located along the valley in the Tarapacá and Antofagasta \nregions of northern Chile (in a part of the cou ntry known as \"El Norte Grande\"). From caliche ore, we \nproduce nitrate and iodine -based products; in addition, caliche also contains concentrations of potassium. \nOur mining interests in the Salar de Atacama brine deposits are located within the Atacama Des ert in the \neastern region of the Norte Grande. From these brines, we produce primarily potassium, sulfate and lithium -\nbased products. Our spodumene mining interests are located at the Earl Grey deposit of the Mt. Holland \nproject in Western Australia. From spodumene, we produce spodumene concentrate and lithium hydroxide.  \nThe following map shows the location of our principal mining operations in Chile and the mining \nconcessions for exploitation and exploration that have been granted to us, as well as the mining properties \nthat we lease from Corfo:   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 107  \nFigure 1.

For a discussion of mining \nconcessions, see \"Individual Material Properties - El Nor te Grande - Mining Concessions for the \nExploration and Exploitation of Caliche\" and \"Mining Concessions for the Exploitation of Brines in the \nSalar de Atacama\".  \nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 99.56% of SQM's mineral interests in Chile were under Mining \nExploitation Concessions and 0.46% were under Mining Exploration Concessions. Of the Mining \nConcessions, approximately 99% have already been granted in acco rdance with applicable Chilean \nlegislation, and approximately 1% are in the process of being granted. Of the Mining Exploration \nConcessions, approximately 100% have already been granted in accordance with applicable Chilean \nlegislation.  \nIn 2023, we made payments of $8.5 million to the Government of Chile for Exploration and Mining \nConcessions, including concessions we lease from Corfo. These payments do not include payments we \nmake directly to Corfo under the Lease Agreement based on perc entages of the sales price of products \nmade from brines from the Salar de Atacama.  \nThe following table shows the Mining Exploration and Exploitation Concessions held by SQM, \nincluding the mining properties we lease from Corfo, as of December 31, 2023:  \n Operating concessions  Exploration concessions   \n Total  \nRegion of Chile  Total number  Hectares  Total number  Hectares  Total number  Hectares  \nRegion I  2.708  508.069  2 1.000  2.710  509.069  \nRegion II  8.889 2.347.798  37 11.900  8.926  2.359.698  \nRegion III and others  460 105.253  1 100 461 105.353  \nTotal  12.057  2.961.120  40 13.000  12.097  2.974.120  \n \nMost of the Mining Concessions held by SQM were requested mainly for non -metallic mining purposes. \nHowever, a small percentage of our Mining Exploration Concessions were requested for metallic mining \npurposes. The annual payment to the Chilean government for this group of concessions is higher.  \nThe current amendments to the Mining Code under Chilean Law 21,420 and others, modified the amount \nof mining protection through the creation of Article 142 bis, determining that, in the new protection \nregime established, a reduced mining patent for the exp loitation of mines is not contemplated. \nconcessions whose economic interest is related to non -metallic substances, however, it allows the \nreduction of patent for exploitation concessions, upon verification of the works in the concession and/or \naccrediting the obtaining of an RCA (Resolución de Calificación Ambiental) with respect to its \nexploration project in the Environmental Impact Study System. \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 110 Mt. Holland's mining rights  \nThe Mt. Holland Lithium project development area for the mine and concentrator is distributed over \nthree main mining properties (M77/1065, M77/1066 and M77/1080), as well as exploration licenses, \ngeneral use licenses and miscellaneous licenses (project pro perties), with an approximate area of 4,606 \nhectares. A summary map showing the main properties is provided in Figure 2.  \nThe majority of the project properties are currently registered equally under MH Gold, an affiliate of \nWesfarmers Limited, and SQM Australia, an affiliate of SQM. Other exploration tenements on the \nproject are registered by MH Gold Pty Ltd or Montague Reso urces Australia Pty Ltd, both of which are \nultimately controlled by Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy and Fertilizers (WesCEF). The project is a joint \nventure, in which SQM owns 50% and Wesfarmers Limited owns the remaining 50% (the \"Mt. Holland \nJoint Venture\" or \"Mt. Holland JV\"), and is managed by Covalent Lithium Pty Ltd (\"Covalent\"), an \nentity owned 50% by SQM and 50% by Wesfarmers. Covalent is neither the registered holder nor the \napplicant for the Project Properties under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) (Mining A ct). \nThe Kwinana refinery development is located on a long -term lease covering 40.5 hectares on Lot 15, \nMason Road in Kwinana. Covalent recorded the lease with Development WA in September 2021.  \nCosts  \nCaliche ore is the key raw material used in the production of iodine, specialty plant nutrition and \nindustrial chemicals.

The efficiency of the process is based on the type of brine extracted in each well during the course  \nof the simulation; the average efficiency of the process over the life -of-mine (LoM) is approximately 52% for lithium and \napproxim ately 74% for potassium.  \n(4) Salar de Atacama, Chile. The average lithium and potassium concentration is weighted by the simulated extraction rates \nin each well.  \n(5) Salar de Atacama, Chile. The mineral resource and reserve estimate considers a cut -off grade of 0.05% w/w for lithium \nbased on lithium product generation cost, lithium carbonate sales and the respective cost margin. Based on historical \nlithium prices since  2010 and forecast to 2040, a projected lithium carbonate price of US$11,000 per metric tonne is \nconsidered with the respective cost and profit margin, with a small increase to accommodate evaporation area and use of \nadditives. A similar analysis was perfo rmed for potassium, where SQM established the 1% w/w cut -off grade based on the \nrespective costs, sales and margin.  \n(6) Salar de Atacama, Chile. This reserve estimate differs from the in -situ reserve base reported previously (SQM, 2020)  and \nconsiders factors modifying the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves, including the design and efficiency \nof the production well field, as well as environmental and process recovery factors. The reserves estimate also considers \nthe expi ration of the Lease in 2030 (end of LoM). The Qualified Person for Mineral Reserves is Rodrigo Riquelme.  \n(7) Mt. Holland, Australia. The tonnage and average grade of the ore reserve have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the \nestimate and figures may not match, due to rounding. Metallurgical processes are designed for a nominal ore feed of 2Mpta. \nConcentrate  process recovery is estimated at 75% for lithium oxide for predominantly spodumene mineralization and 0% \nfor other types of mineralization. Refinery process recovery is estimated at 85%. Tantalum recovery is estimated at 0%. In \nthe reserves evaluation, a total operating cost of US$4,979 per metric ton was considered for LiOH production. The price, \ncost and mass throughput parameters, together with the internal constraints of the current operations, result in an ore reser ve \ncut-off grade of 0.5% Li2O based on a lithium hydroxide sales price of US$11,000 per tonne at FOB price. The Qualified \nPerson for the Mineral Reserves is David Billington, with an effective date of December 15, 2021. No material changes \nare reported since the last update.  \n(8) El Norte Grande Caliche, Chile. The cutoff grades of the Proven and Probable Reserves vary according to the targets \nrequired at the different mines. The assigned values correspond to the averages of the different sectors. The cut -off grade \nis by nitrate content, considering also the iodi ne grade.  \n(9) El Norte Grande Caliche, Chile. The average overall metallurgical recovery of the nitrate and iodine processes contained \nin the recovered material varies between 50% and 70%.  \n(10) The mineral resource and reserve estimate considers a cut -off grade of 300ppm for iodine (I 2 ) based on the production \ncosts of iodine and iodine by -products. Based on 2010 historical iodine prices and the 2040 forecast, a projected iodine \nprice of US$42,000 per metric ton is determined, taking into account the corresponding planned operating, fi nancial and \ninvestment costs, depreciation, profit margin and taxes. A similar analysis was performed for nitrates, where SQM \nestablished the 3.0% sodium nitrate cu t-off grade based on the respective costs for the production of potassium -sodium \nnitrates (fertilizers). SQM considers a projected price of US$820 per metric ton of sodium and potassium nitrates in the \neconomic analysis performed since 2010 and forecast to  2040. Historical operating use modifying factors at several of \nSQM's mining facilities are applied to the iodine and nitrate grades reported as probable resource estimates, the factors \napplied to the iodine and nitrate grades are 0.9 and 0.85 respectively . The Qualified Persons for the Nueva Victoria and \nPampa Blanca ore reserves are Marco Fazzi, Marco Lema and Gino Slanzi.  \n   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 114 Summary of mineral resources excluding reserves at the end of the fiscal year ended December \n31, 2023(1),(2),(3) \n \nMineral resources  \nmeasured  Mineral resources  \nindicated   \nIndicated and measured \nmineral resources  Inferred mineral \nresources  \nAtacama Salt Flat, Chile  \n \nQuantity  \n(Vol Mm )3 Grade  \n(% Li by \nweight)  Quantity  \n(Vol \nMm )3 Grade  \n(% Li by weight)  Quantity  \n(Vol Mm \n)3 Grade  \n(% Li by weight)  Quantity  \n(Vol Mm )3 Grade  \n(% Li by \nweight)  \nLithium -Salts :(4), \n(5) 2.254  0,20 1.435  0,160  3.689  0,180  1.614  0,133  \nMt.

There is no certainty that all or \npart of the mineral resource will be converted to mineral reserves after the application of modifying factors.  \n(4) Salar de Atacama, Chile. Mineral Resources are reported as in -situ and exclude Mineral Reserves, where the estimated \nMineral Reserve without processing losses during the reported LOM and the reported 2023 actual extraction were \nsubtracted from the Mineral Resource, including Mineral Reserves. A direct correlation was assumed between Proven \nReserves and Measured Resources, as well as Probable Reserves and Indicated Resources. The Qualified Person for \nMineral Resources is Juan Becerra.  \n(5) Salar de Atacama, Chile. The mineral resource and reserve estimate considers a cut -off grade of 0.05% w/w for lithium \nbased on lithium product generation cost, lithium carbonate sales and the respective cost margin. Based on historical \nlithium prices since  2010 and forecast to 2040, a projected lithium carbonate price of US$11,000 per metric tonne is \nconsidered with the respective cost and profit margin, plus a small increase to adjust for evaporation area and use of \nadditives. A similar analysis was perfor med for potassium, where SQM established the 1% w/w cut -off grade based on the \nrespective costs, sales and margin.  \n(6) Mt. Holland, Australia. Mineral resource tonnage and average contained grade were rounded to reflect the accuracy of the \nestimate and figures may not match, due to rounding. Mineral resources are reported as exclusive of mineral reserves. The \ndisclosed res ource corresponds to resources attributable to SQM. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not \nhave demonstrated economic viability. The resources have been reported as in situ (hard rock within an optimized resource \npit). Resource pit optimizat ion and economic parameters for the derivation of the cut -off grade include a mine gate price \nof US$800 FOB per tonne of 6% Li2O concentrate, mining cost of AUS$19 per bcm (average LoM variable cost per \ndepth), processing cost of AU$65 per tonne. Mining di lution set at 5% and recovery at 95%. Royalty rates of 5%. \nOptimization considered for the concentrator is 75%. Costs estimated in Australian dollars were converted to US dollars \nbased on an AU$0.75:US$1.00 exchange rate. These economics define a 0.50% Li2 O cut -off grade. Kerry Griffin is the \nQualified Person responsible for the mineral resource estimate with an effective date of October 6, 2021. No material \nchanges are reported since the last update.  \n(7) El Norte Grande, Caliche, Chile. To calculate Measured Resources, SQM uses the results of the RGM100T and RGM50 \ndata combined in a 3D block model built with Krigeage  and applying some criteria: caliche thickness ≥ 2.0 m; overburden \nthickness ≤3.0 m; residue/mineral ratio ≤ 1.5; and NaNO3 (3%) and iodine (300 ppm) cut -off grades. For the calculation \nof Indicated Resources, SQM uses the results of the RGM100 and RGM200 data combined using a model obtained from \nInverse distance estimation (IVOR). To evaluate Probable Reserves, a reduction in grades must be considered as a \nconsequence of the geological variability of the deposit that determines a contrasting decrease in gr ades when going from \n200x200m research grids to smaller 100T (~70x70m) or 50x50m grids. The Mineral Resource estimates were prepared by \nMarco Fazzi (who is the Qualified Person for these Mineral Resource estimates), and were reported using SK 1300 \nDefiniti on Standards adopted in December 2018. The Qualified Persons for Mineral Reserves for Nueva Victoria and \nPampa Blanca are Marco Fazzi, Marco Lema and Gino Slanzi.  \n(8) El Norte Grande, Caliche, Chile. The estimate was completed using a SG of 2.1 ton/m³. The cut -off grade for iodine is 300 \nppm. The cut -off grades of the mineral resources vary according to the targets required at the different mines. The values \nassigned correspond to the averages of the d ifferent sectors. For all our sites, the cut -off grade is by nitrate content \nconsidering iodine. The ore reserve estimate considers a cut -off grade of 300ppm for iodine (I2) based on the production \ncosts of iodine and its b y-products. Based on 2010 historical iodine prices and the forecast to 2040, a projected iodine price \nof US$42,000 per metric ton is determined, taking into account the corresponding planned operating, financial and  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 116 investment costs, depreciation, profit margin and taxes. A similar analysis was performed for nitrates, where SQM set the \ncut-off grade of 3.0% NaNO3 based on the respective costs for the production of potassium -sodium nitrates (fertilizers). \nSQM considers  a projected price of US$820/metric ton for sodium and potassium nitrates in the economic analysis \nperformed from 2010 and forecast to 2040.  \n \nIndividual materiality properties  \nIn determining our individually significant mining operations under SK -1300, management considered \nboth quantitative and qualitative factors, evaluated in the context of our overall business and financial \ncondition. Such evaluation included our aggregates mining operations at all of our mining properties, \nregardless of the stage of production or type of ore produced. Quantitative factors included, among \nothers, the relative contributions of mining operations to our historical and estimated aggregate revenue s, \ncash flows and EBITDA. Qualitative factors may include, as appropriate, capital expansion plans, long -\nterm price outlook, the regulatory environment and various strategic priorities.  \nWe concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our mines of individual materiality are the caliche mines \nat Nueva Victoria, Pampa Blanca and Pampa Orcoma in the Norte Grande region of Chile, the brines in \nthe Salar de Atacama in Chile and the Mt. Holland lith ium project in Western Australia. We will update \nour assessment of the materiality mines on an annual basis.  \nThe following information regarding such materiality properties, for the most part, is derived from and, \nin some cases, is an extract of TRS relating to such properties, prepared in accordance with Section \n601(b)(96) and SK -1300. Portions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications \nand procedures that are not fully described in this document. Reference should be made to the full text \nof the TRS, incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Annual Report on Form 20 -F.  \nProperties and Facilities in the Norte Grande Caliche, Chile  \nOur mining operations are concentrated in the First Region of Chile, where we work mainly in the Tente \nen el Aire, Nueva Victoria Oeste, Hermosa and Torcaza mining areas, while in the Second Region we \nwork in the Pampa Blanca mining area.  \nThe Norte Grande Caliche, which is located in Regions I and II of northern Chile, corresponds to flat \nareas or \"pampas\" that have been extensively explored. Results indicate that these prospects contain \nnitrate and iodine mineralization. The area is access ible from Santiago via Route 5. The mineralization \nis stratiform in style, with a wide areal distribution, forming \"spots\" of several kilometers in extension, \nwhere the thicknesses of mineralization are variable. As a result of geological activity over tim e \n(volcanism, weathering, faulting) the deposits can be found as continuous mantos. Environmental \npermits for mining operations and the corresponding Environmental Qualification Resolution grant \naccess to the required water and electricity supply, as well as the necessary infrastructure for the mining \noperation.  \nFacilities  \nNew Victory  \nThe Nueva Victoria mine and facilities are located 140 kilometers southeast of Iquique and are accessible \nby road. Since 2007, the Nueva Victoria mine has included the Soronal, Mapocho and Iris mining \nproperties. At this site, we use caliche to produce nit rate and iodine -rich salts through heap leaching and \nthe use of solar evaporation ponds. The main production facilities at this site include the heap leach \noperation centers, the iodide and iodine plants at Nueva Victoria and Iris, and the evaporation pond s in \nthe Sur Viejo sector of the site. The areas currently in operation are located approximately 27 kilometers  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 117 northeast of Nueva Victoria. Solar energy and electricity are the main sources of power for this operation. \nNitrate -rich salts are sent to Coya Sur, which is a processing plant located approximately 15 kilometers \nsouth of Maria Elena, and production activi ties there are associated with the production of potassium \nnitrate and finished products. The main production facilities at this site include four potassium nitrate \nplants with a total capacity of 1,300,000 metric tons per year. It also has four crystalliz ed nitrate \nproduction lines, with a total capacity of 1,200,000 metric tons per year, and a pelletizing plant with a \ncapacity of 360,000 metric tons per year. The potassium nitrate produced at Coya Sur is an intermediate \nproduct used as raw material for th e production of finished products (crystallized nitrates and granulated \nnitrates). Therefore, the production capacities listed above are not independent of each other and cannot \nbe added together to obtain an overall total capacity. Natural gas is the main  source of energy for our \noperation at Coya Sur.  \nPampa Blanca  \nThe Pampa Blanca mine and project facilities are located in the Antofagasta Region of northern Chile. \nIt is located 100 kilometers northeast of the city of Antofagasta, in the commune of Sierra Gorda. The \nproperty has an area of 51,201 hectares and consist s of 152 mining concessions. The Pampa Blanca \nProject aims to produce salts rich in iodide, iodine and nitrate from the processing of caliche that will be \nextracted from deposits rich in this mineral. The Pampa Blanca Mining Plan considers an initial \nextra ction of caliche at a rate of 5.0 million metric tons per year between 2024 -2029, followed by an \nextraction rate of 12 million metric tons per year starting in 2030. For the 2024 -2030 period, a total \nextraction of 42 million metric tons of caliche with an average grade of 444 ppm iodine and 6.1% nitrates \nis projected. The production process to obtain iodine as the main product, along with salts rich in sodium \nnitrate and potassium nitrate as by -products, consists of heap leaching with fresh water or recircu lated \nsolutions to obtain an iodate -rich solution, which will then be treated in a chemical plant to transform it \ninto elemental iodine in prill format. Solar energy and electricity are the main energy sources for this \noperation. The project facilities als o include heap leach operation centers, iodide plant and evaporation \nponds.  \nPampa Orcoma  \nThe Pampa Orcoma Project is located in the Tarapacá Region, in northern Chile. It is located 99 \nkilometers northeast of the city of Iquique, in the community of Huara. The property has an area of \n10,296 hectares and is composed of 45 mining concessions. Th e Pampa Orcoma Project aims to produce \nsalts rich in iodide, iodine and nitrate by processing caliche that will be extracted from deposits rich in \nthis mineral. The Pampa Orcoma Mining Plan considers an initial extraction of caliche at a rate of 8.4 \nmillio n metric tons for the first year to the fourth year, followed by an extraction of 20 million metric \ntons from the fifth year onwards. For the 16 -year mine life, a total extraction of 287.4 million metric tons \nof caliche with an average grade of 408 ppm iod ine and 6.7% nitrates is projected. The production \nprocess to obtain iodine as the main product, in addition to salts rich in sodium nitrate and potassium \nnitrate as by -products, consists of leaching with seawater or recirculated solutions to obtain a solu tion \nrich in iodate, which will then be treated in chemical plants to transform it into elemental iodine in the \nform of granules. The Pampa Orcoma Project contemplates the construction of the following facilities: \niodide and iodine production plants with a  capacity of 2,500 metric tons per year (iodine equivalent), \nevaporation ponds to produce nitrate -rich salts at a rate of 320,325 metric tons per year, and a seawater \nadduction pipeline to meet water needs. Solar energy and electricity are the main energy sources for this \nfuture operation. Development of the Pampa Orcoma project was postponed to 2030, with no changes to \nthe project information provided as of December 31, 2022.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 118 The following table provides a summary of our El Norte Grande production facilities as of December \n31, 2023:  \nInstallation  Type of installation  Approximat\ne size \n(hectares) (1) Nominal production \ncapacity ( \nthousands of metric \ntons/year)  Average  \nage (2) Gross book value  \n(US$ millions) (2) \nSouth Coya(3),(4)   Nitrate production  1.518  Potassium nitrate: 1,300 \nCrystallized nitrates: 1,200 \nPrilled  \nnitrates: 360  11,37 676,3 \nNew Victory (5),(7)  Concentrated nitrate \nsalts and iodine \nproduction  47.492  Iodine: 13.0  11,26 292,5 \nPampa Blanca(6) Concentrated nitrate \nsalts and iodide \nproduction.  4,808  Iodide:1,3  16,73 8,1 \nPampa Orcoma(8) Concentrated nitrate \nsalts and iodine \nproduction  7.387  Iodine: 2.5  - - \n________________  \n(1) The approximate size considers that both the production facilities and the mine for Nueva Victoria are those authorized \nfor exploitation by the environmental authority and/or Sernageomin.  \n(2) The weighted average age and gross book value correspond to the production facilities, excluding the Nueva Victoria \nmine and the Port of Tocopilla facilities.  \n(3) Includes production facilities and solar evaporation ponds.  \n(4) Potassium nitrate produced at Coya Sur is an intermediate product that is used as raw material for the production of \nfinished products (crystallized nitrates and granulated nitrates).

These facilities are free and clear of any material liens or encumbrances, and \nwe believe that they are adequate and app ropriate for the business we conduct there.  \nExtraction yields  \nThe following table sets forth certain operating data related to each of our El Norte Grande mines for \n2023, 2022 and 2021:  \n \n \n  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 119 (in thousands, unless otherwise indicated)  2023  2022  2021  \nCoya Sur (1)    \nMetric tons produced of crystallized nitrate  642 725 820 \nNew Victory     \nMetric tons of ore extracted   43.450  44.324  41.428  \nIodine (ppm)   398 430 441 \nMetric tons of iodine produced   13,9 12,4 10,2 \n________________  \n(1) Includes production of finished products at Coya Sur from the treatment of nitrate solutions at María Elena and Pedro \nde Valdivia, nitrate salts from the treatment of piles at Nueva Victoria and net production of NPT or technical grade \npotassium nitrate plants.  \n(2) Includes iodine production in prilled format from the Nueva Victoria and Pedro de Valdivia facilities.  \n \nReserves and resources  \nAccording to our experience in caliche ore, grid pattern drilling with spacing between 50 and 100 meters \nproduces caliche resource data sufficiently defined to consider them as measured resources and then, \nadjusting for technical, economic and legal aspect s, as proven reserves. These reserves are obtained \nthrough the Kriging Method and the application of operating parameters to obtain economically \nprofitable reserves.  \nSimilarly, information obtained from detailed geological work and samples taken from grid drilling at \nspacings between 100 and 200 meters can be used to determine indicated resources. By adjusting these \nindicated resources to account for technical, economi c and legal factors, it is possible to calculate \nprobable reserves. Probable reserves are calculated using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) \ngeostatistical technique and have a greater uncertainty or margin of error than proven reserves. However, \nthe de gree of certainty of probable reserves is high enough to assume continuity between observation \npoints.  \nThe conversion of resources into reserves requires the consideration of modifying factors, the most \nrelevant of which is the existence of a valid environmental license (RCA or Sectorial Authorization). \nThe criteria for the conversion of resources into rese rves, based on the criterion of the modifying factor \nof the environmental license, adopted for caliche mines, are as follows:  \n1. Criteria for conversion of unit tonnage into measured resources and indicated resources.  \n2. Grade conversion criteria: unit factor for measured resources and less than unity and variable \naccording to the mine, for iodine and nitrate grades, for the indicated resources, due to the \nvariability of the deposit.  \n3. Application of the factor associated with the corresponding environmental permit, not qualifying \nas reserves the resources defined in sectors without an environmental permit, and qualifying as \nproven/probable reserves those measured/indicated resources ass ociated with sectors with an \nenvironmental permit in force or Sectorial Authorization in force.  \n \n \n  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 120 New Victoria: Summary of mineral reserves at the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, \n2023 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \n Quantity \n(Mt) Nitrate grade (  \n% by weight)  Iodine grade (  \nParts per million (ppm))  Cutting laws1 Metallurgical \nrecovery2 \nProven mineral reserves  202 5,6 432 \nNitrate 3.0% \nIodine 300 \nppm 50%-70% Probable ore reserves  529 5,1 415 \nTotal mineral reserves  731 5,2 420 \n______________  \n(1) Mineral reserves are based on measured and indicated mineral resources at an operating limit of 3.0% nitrate and 300 \nppm for iodine.

Alternatively, we may apply for an exploitation concession in respect of the \narea covered by the original exploration concession, which m ust be made within the term \nestablished by the original exploration concession.  \n \n(3) In addition, the current amendments to the Mining Code under Law 21,420 and others, modified \nthe term of exploration concessions, which will be four years, allowing the term to be extended \nfor up to four more years on a one -time basis if geological informa tion is available. delivered as \na result of exploration or if an RCA has been obtained or an eligible project has been entered \ninto the Environmental Impact Assessment System.  \nA Mineral Exploration Concession is generally obtained for the purpose of evaluating mineral resources \nin a defined area. If the holder of the Mineral Exploration Concession determines that the area does not \ncontain commercially exploitable mineral resourc es, the Mineral Exploration Concession is generally \nallowed to lapse. It is also possible to apply for a Mining Concession without having previously obtained \na Mining Exploration Concession for the area in question.  \nAs of December 31, 2023, the area covered by Mining Concessions that have been granted in relation to \nthe caliche resources of our mining sites is approximately 543,100 hectares. Likewise, as of December \n31, 2023, the area covered by Mining Exploration Con cessions in relation to the caliche resources of our \nmining sites is approximately 400 hectares. We have not applied for additional mining rights.  \nProperties and Facilities in the Salar de Atacama, Chile  \nSQM's operations in the Salar de Atacama are located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, which includes \nthe Province of El Loa and the commune of San Pedro de Atacama. The Salar de Atacama Project for \nthe treatment of brine to obtain lithium and potassium salts is currently in operation and is in the \nproduction stage. The Salar de Atacama core is owned by Chile's Corporación de Fomento de la \nProducción (CORFO), which grants special operating contracts or administrative leases to private \ncompanies for brine extraction. SQM and Albemarle have a lease agreement with CORFO to extract and \nproduce lithium from brine stored in the Salar de Atacama deposit. Consequently, SQM must comply \nwith the terms of the contract and also with the conditions established in the c urrent RCAs to maintain \noperations in the Salar de Atacama. Exploration is routinely carried out within the established areas.  \nSQM leases an area of approximately 1,400 square kilometers with a permit to extract brines from an \narea of 820 square kilometers with two main operations. It currently produces lithium at its southwest \noperation. The lease was signed in 1993 and expires o n December 31, 2030.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 126 The nearest cities are Calama and Antofagasta, located 160 and 230 kilometers west of the site, \nrespectively. From Calama, the road to the site is via Route R -23 and, from Antofagasta, it is via Route \nB-385. \nSQM's mineral resource in the Salar de Atacama consists of in -situ brine within a porous medium and \nthe resource estimate depends on brine concentration, aquifer geometry and interconnected drainable \npore volume. Within the SQM concessions, lithium and pot assium resources were estimated based on \nextensive exploration and many depth -specific samples from each unit.  \nThe geology of the Salar de Atacama is characterized by Paleozoic to Holocene igneous and sedimentary \nrocks, as well as recent unconsolidated clastic deposits and evaporite sequences. The salar itself resides \nin a tectonic basin of recent compressional -transpressional behavior and is bounded by high -angle \nreverse and strike -slip faults. The surface of the Salar de Atacama is made up of recent evaporite deposits \nwhere, over time, the evaporation process has precipitated salts, and superficial clastic sedimen ts are \nfound mainly along the margins of the salar. The salt crust is composed mainly of halite, sulfates and \noccasionally organic matter, with alluvial facies in the peripheral areas. Evaporite and clastic deposits \nwithin the salar host brine at depth and  are bounded and cut by local fault systems. Several structural \nblocks have been identified, due to recent fault displacement.  \nThe salar system of the Salar de Atacama basin is typical of a mature salar, with a core consisting of a \nthick section of halite (>90%) with sulfate and a smaller percentage of clastic sediments, as well as some \nintercalated clayey sediments and sulfates, over an area of 1,100 square kilometers and to a depth of 900 \nmeters. Within SQM's concessions, mineralization includes lithium and potassium -rich brines in porous \nmedia in different zones and depths of the Salar de Atacama core.  \nFacilities  \nOur Salar de Atacama facilities are located 210 kilometers east of the city of Antofagasta and 190 \nkilometers southeast of the city of María Elena. At this site, we use brines extracted from the salar to \nproduce potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and li thium chloride solutions, which are then sent to our \nLithium Chemical Plant for processing. The main production plants at this site include the solar \nevaporation pond systems, the potassium chloride flotation plants (MOP -H I and II), the potassium \ncarnalli te plants (PC I and extension PC I), the potassium sulfate flotation plant (SOP -H), the potassium \nchloride drying plant (Dual Plant or MOP -S), the potassium chloride compaction plant (MOP -G3), the \npotassium sulfate drying plant (SOP -S) and the potassium su lfate compaction plant (SOP -G). The energy \nused consists mainly of solar energy, as well as electricity, fuel and gas sources.  \nThe site of the Lithium Chemical Plant facility is located approximately 20 kilometers east of \nAntofagasta. The production plants at this facility include the lithium carbonate plant, with a production \ncapacity of 200,000 tons per year, and the lithium hyd roxide plant, with a production capacity of 30,000 \ntons per year. Lithium chloride (LiCl) solution is concentrated and purified in the lithium chemical plants \nthrough contaminant removal stages (specifically boron, magnesium and calcium content) and \nconver sion reaction to produce: technical grade lithium carbonate, battery grade lithium carbonate, \ntechnical grade lithium hydroxide and battery grade lithium hydroxide. Electricity and natural gas are \nthe main sources of energy for our Lithium Chemical Plant o perations.  \nThe following table provides a summary of our Salar de Atacama production facilities as of December \n31, 2023:   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 127 Installation  Type of installation  Approximate \nsize \n(hectares) (1) Nominal production capacity ( \nthousands of metric tons/year)  Weighted \naverage age  \n(years) (2) Gross book value  \n(US$ millions) (2) \nAtacama Salt Flat\n  Potassium chloride, \npotassium sulfate, \nlithium chloride and \nboric acid production  35.911  Lithium sulfate: 90  \nPotassium chloride: 2,680 \nPotassium sulfate: 245  \nBoric acid: 15  17,64  1.697,5 \nLithium \nChemical Plant , \nAntofagasta   Lithium carbonate \nand lithium \nhydroxide production  126 Lithium  carbonate: 200  \nLithium hydroxide: 30  8,30 1.051 ,6 \n________________  \n(1) For the Salar de Atacama, the approximate size considers both the production facilities and the mine. Mining areas \nare those authorized for exploitation by the environmental authority and/or Sernageomin.  \n(2) The weighted average age and gross book value correspond to the production facilities, excluding the mine, of the \nSalar de Atacama.  \nDirectly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, we own, lease or hold concessions over the facilities in which \nwe conduct our operations. These facilities are free and clear of any material liens or encumbrances, and \nwe believe that they are adequate and app ropriate for the business we conduct therein.  \nExtraction yields  \nThe following table sets forth certain operating data related to each of our Salar de Atacama operations \nfor 2023, 2022 and 2021:  \n(in thousands, unless otherwise indicated)  2023  2022  2021  \nAtacama  Salt Flat (1)    \nMetric tons produced of potassium chloride, potassium \nsulfate and potassium salts   1.208 984 1.407  \nMetric tons of dry lithium sulfate produced  51,1 18,9 - \nLithium  Chemical Plant (1)    \nMetric tons produced of lithium carbonate   165,5  152,5  108,4  \n________________  \n(1) Lithium carbonate is produced from a concentrated lithium chloride solution obtained from the Salar de Atacama and \nprocessed at our facilities at the Lithium Chemical Plant near Antofagasta. Potassium salts include synthetic sylvinite, \nproduced at the plan t, and other harvested potassium salts (natural sylvinite, carnallites and plant pond harvests) that \nare sent to Coya Sur for the production of crystallized nitrates.  \nReserves and resources  \nThe mineral reserve of potassium and lithium dissolved in the brines of the Salar de Atacama was \nestimated considering the modifying factors for the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves, \nincluding the design and efficiency of the production well field, pumping scheme and lithium and \npotassium recovery factors. Projected future brine extraction was simulated using a groundwater flow \nand solute transport model. The numerical modeling was supported by a detailed calibration process and \nhydrogeol ogical, geological and hydrochemical data within the mining concessions. Based on the current  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 128 producing well field, which corresponds to the most representative mineral resource and reserve \nstatement effective date of 2023, we estimate our proven and probable lithium and potassium reserves \nto be as follows:  \nSalar de Atacama: Summary of mineral reserves, considering process recoveries (effective as of \nDecember 31, 2023)1,2,3,4,5,6 \n Brine \nvolume  \n(million \ncubic \nmeters)  Quantity  \n(million \nmetric \ntons)  Grade/Quality  \n(% weight)  Shear laws  \n(% weight)  Metallurgical \nrecovery (%)  \nLithium       \nProven mineral reserves (years 1-\n3) 104 0.13 0.20 0.05 52 \nProbable mineral reserves (years \n4-7) 107 0.14 0.20 0.05 52 \nTotal mineral reserves  211 0.27 0.20 0.05 52 \nPotassium       \nProven mineral reserves (years 1-\n3) 104 2.20 2.31 1.00 74 \nProbable mineral reserves (years \n4-7) 107 2.12 2.16 1.00 74 \nTotal mineral reserves  211 4.32 2.24 1.00 74 \n___________  \n(1) Process efficiency is based on the type of brine extracted in each well during the course of the simulation, the average \nprocess efficiency across the LoM is approximately 52% for lithium and approximately 74% for potassium.  \n(2) The values in the \"Quantity\" column correspond to the lithium metal (LME) and potassium content.  \n(3) The average lithium and potassium concentration is weighted by the simulated extraction rates at each well.  \n(4) Comparisons of values may not match, due to rounding of numbers and differences caused by averaging.  \n(5) The mineral resource and reserve estimate considers a cut -off grade of 0.05% w/w for lithium, based on the cost of \nlithium product generation, lithium carbonate sales and the respective cost margin. Based on historical lithium prices \nsince 2010 and forecas t to 2040, a projected lithium carbonate price of US$11,000 per metric tonne is considered, \nwith the respective cost and profit margin, plus a small increase to adjust for evaporation area and additive use. A \nsimilar analysis was performed for K, where SQM  established the 1% w/w cut -off grade based on the respective costs, \nsales and margin.  \n(6) This reserve estimate differs from the in -situ reserve base previously reported by SQM in 2020 (SQM, 2020)  and \nconsiders factors modifying the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves, including the design and \nefficiency of the production well field, as well as environmental and process recovery factors. The reserves estimate \nalso considers the expi ry of the Lease in 2030 (end of LoM). The Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserves is Rodrigo \nRiquelme.  \n \nProduction well locations are based on measured and indicated resource zones. Due to brine mixing over \ntime, hydrogeological processes and pumping effects, the mineral reserve was classified as a function of \ntime:  \n• The Proved Reserves were specified for the first 3 years of the simulation, since the model is \nadequately calibrated for the period 2015 -2020, and the initial part of the projected simulation \nhas higher confidence, due to expected short -term changes in pum ping, conceptual hydraulic \nparameters and water balance, among other factors.  \n \n• Probable Reserves were assigned conservatively for the last 4 years of the simulation, \nconsidering that the numerical model will be continuously improved and recalibrated in the  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 129 future, due to possible medium and long term changes in neighboring pumping, conceptual \nhydraulic parameters and water balance, among other factors.  \n \nProbable reserves and inferred resources are continually being explored in order to reclassify them as \nproved reserves and indicated or measured resources, respectively. This exploration includes systematic \npacker testing, chemical brine sampling and long -term pilot production pumping tests.  \nAs a complement to the reserves  information, SQM has an environmental impact study (RCA 226/06) \nthat defines a maximum brine extraction until the end of the Lease Contract (December 31, 2030). \nConsidering the maximum net brine production rates authorized by (RCA 226/06) and the voluntar y \nreduction plan announced by SQM, which is characterized by a reduction in future pumping from 1,166 \nl/s to 822 l/s during the 7 -year LoM, a total of approximately 211 million cubic meters of brine, \ncorresponding to 0.27 million metric tons of lithium, wi ll be extracted from the wells.  \nThe lithium and potassium resource was classified into 3 categories (measured, indicated, inferred) \naccording to the amount of information from the hydrogeological units, as well as geostatistical criteria. \nHydrogeological knowledge was prioritized as the first classification criterion based on exploration, \nmonitoring and historical production data, while geostatistical variables were used as a secondary \ncriterion. We estimate our lithium and potassium resources as of December 31, 2020, which we also \nconsid er to be an adequate proxy for December 31, 2023, as follows:  \nSalar de Atacama: Summary of mineral resources, excluding mineral reserves (effective \nDecember 31, 2023)1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \n Brine \nvolume  \n(million \ncubic \nmeters)  Quantity  \n(million \nmetric \ntons)  Grade/Quality  \n(% weight)  Shear laws  \n(% weight)  \nLithium      \nMeasured mineral resources  2,254  5.4 0.20 0.05 \nIndicated mineral resources  1,435  2.8 0.16 0.05 \nMeasured + indicated mineral \nresources  3,689  8.2 0.18 0.05 \nInferred mineral resources  1,614  2.6 0.13 0.05 \nPotassium      \nMeasured mineral resources  2,254  49.8 1.80 1.00 \nIndicated mineral resources  1,435  30.0 1.70 1.00 \nMeasured + indicated mineral \nresources  3,689  79.8 1.77 1.00 \nInferred mineral resources  1,614  34.9 1.77 1.00 \n______________  \n(1) Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have no demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that \nall or part of the mineral resource will be converted to mineral reserves after the application of modifying factors.  \n(2) Mineral Resources are reported as in situ and exclude Mineral Reserves, where the estimated Mineral Reserve without \nprocessing losses during the reported LoM. A direct correlation was assumed between Proven Reserves and Measured \nResources, as well as Proba ble Reserves and Indicated Resources.  \n(3) Effective porosity was used to estimate drainable brine volume based on SQM porosity laboratory measurement \ntechniques (Gas Displacement Pycnometer). The Qualified Person believes that the high frequency sampling of \neffective porosity, its large data set a nd the general lack of material where specific retention may be dominant allows \neffective porosity to be a reasonable parameter for resource estimation.  \n(4) The values in the \"Quantity\" column correspond to the lithium metal (LME) and potassium contained.  \n(5) Comparison of values may not match, due to rounding of numbers and differences caused by averaging.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 130 (6) The mineral resource and reserve estimate considers a cut -off grade of 0.05% w/w for lithium, based on the cost of \nlithium product generation, lithium carbonate sales and the respective cost margin. Based on historical lithium prices \nsince 2010 and forecas t to 2040, a projected lithium carbonate price of US$11,000 per metric tonne is considered with \nthe respective cost and profit margin, plus a small increase to adjust for evaporation area and use of additives. A \nsimilar analysis was performed for potassium , where SQM established the 1% w/w cut -off grade based on the \nrespective costs, sales and margin.  \n(7) Juan Becerra is the Qualified Person responsible for Mineral Resources.  \nBecause both lithium and potassium are extracted from the same brines in the Salar de Atacama, the \nfollowing discussion of changes in mineral reserves and resources in the Salar de Atacama applies to \nboth lithium and potassium. The Salar de Atacama brine p roven mineral reserves of 104 million cubic \nmeters at December 31, 2023 decreased by 27% from 143 million cubic meters at December 31, 2022. \nThe Salar de Atacama brine probable ore reserves of 107 million cubic meters at December 31, 2023 \nremained unchange d from the amounts at December 31, 2022. The Salar de Atacama brine measured, \nindicated and inferred mineral resources, excluding reserves, of 2,254 million cubic meters, 1,435 million \ncubic meters and 1,614 million cubic meters at December 31, 2023. respe ctively, remained unchanged \nfrom the amounts at December 31, 2022 because the mineral resource excluding mineral reserve \nrepresents the existing resource after the LoM, and none of the mineral resources declared in 2022 have \nbeen converted to mineral reser ves.  \nThe information presented in the tables above for the Salar de Atacama was validated by:  \nMr. Rodrigo Riquelme Tapia is a Mining Engineer. He is currently partner and General Manager of \nGeoInnova, located at Antonio Bellet 444, Of. 1301, Providencia, Metropolitan Region, Chile.

These rights are \nowned by Corfo and are leased to SQM Salar pursuant to the Lease Agreement. Corfo cannot unilaterally \nmodify the Lease Agreement and the rights to exploit the resources cannot be transferred. The Lease \nAgre ement provides for SQM Salar to (i) make quarterly lease payments to Corfo based on product sales  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 131 from leased mineral properties and annual research and development contributions to local communities, \nthe Regional Government of Antofagasta and the municipalities of San Pedro de Atacama, Maria Elena \nand Antofagasta, (ii) maintain Corfo's rights to the M ining Concessions and (iii) make annual payments \nto the Government of Chile for such concession rights. The Lease Agreement was entered into in 1993 \nand expires on December 31, 2030.  \nUnder the terms of the Project Agreement, Corfo agreed that it will not allow any other person to explore, \nexploit or extract any mineral resource in the approximately 140,000 hectare area of the Salar de Atacama \nmentioned above. The Project Agreement expi res on December 31, 2030.  \nSQM Salar holds an additional 242,868 hectares of Mining Concessions in areas close to the Salar de \nAtacama, which correspond to mineral reserves that have not been exploited. SQM Salar also has Mining \nExploitation Concessions that are in the process of be ing granted for 11,000 hectares in areas close to \nthe Salar de Atacama.  \nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, SQM Salar had Mining Exploration Concessions covering \napproximately 400 hectares and has applied for additional Mining Exploration Concessions covering \napproximately 2,900 hectares. The exploration rights are valid for  two years, after which time we can (i) \napply for a Mining Exploitation Concession for the land, (ii) apply for an extension of the Mining \nExploration Concession for an additional two years (the extension only applies to a reduced surface \nequivalent to 50%  of the initial area) or (iii) let the concession expire. Additionally, the current \namendments to the Mining Code under Law 21,420 and others, modified the term of the exploration \nconcessions, which will be four years, allowing to extend the term for up to  four more years only once \nif geological information is submitted as a result of the exploration or if an RCA has been obtained or an \nadmissible project has been submitted to the Environmental Impact Assessment System.  \nUnder the terms of the Lease Agreement, with respect to lithium production, the Chilean Nuclear Energy \nCommission (CCHEN) established a total cumulative extraction limit, set as amended by the Corfo \nArbitration Agreement in January 2018, of up to 349,553 m etric tons of lithium metal equivalent \n(1.860,670 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent), which is in addition to the remaining approximately \n64,816 metric tonnes of lithium metal equivalent (345,015 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent) of the \namount o riginally authorized in the aggregate for all periods while the Lease Agreement is in effect. As \nof December 31, 2023, only 7 years remain on the Lease.  \nThe Environmental Qualification Resolution, RCA No. 226/2006, issued on October 19, 2006 by \nCOREMA (Regional Environmental Commission) authorizes SQM to extract brine through pumping \nwells from two areas in the west and parts in the southwest of the areas defined in the Lease Agreement. \nSQM refers to these brine extraction areas as AAE zones (Áreas Autorizadas para la Extracción or \nAuthorized Extraction Areas), and they are divided based on the products historically generated in each \nsector: (i) The norther n part is called AAE -SOP, where \"SOP\" stands for sulfate of potash (potassium \nsulfate product), and covers an area of 10.512 ha, equivalent to 29.27% of the total SSA area; (ii) the \nsouthern portion is called SSA -MOP, where \"MOP\" indicates muriate of potas h (potassium chloride \nproduct), covering an area of 25,399 ha, equivalent to 70.73% of the total SSA area.  \nSQM routinely carries out exploration activities within the areas involved in the Lease Agreement and \nauthorized by the Environmental Permits. These are intended to maintain the number of wells necessary \nfor production.  \nThe water that SQM uses for its mineral production in the Salar de Atacama is obtained from wells \nlocated in the alluvial aquifer on the eastern edge of the Salar, for which the Company has groundwater  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 132 use rights, as well as the corresponding environmental authorization (RCA 226/2006). As part of the \nvoluntary sustainability commitment assumed by SQM in 2020, the Company will reduce its water \nconsumption by up to 50% by 2030.  \nSQM's operations are subject to certain risk factors that may affect SQM's business, financial conditions, \ncash flow or operating results, such as: the potential impossibility to extend or renew the mining rights \nin the Salar de Atacama beyond the expirati on date defined (December 31, 2030) in the CORFO -SQM \nlease agreement, risks related to being a Chilean -based company, potential political risks, as well as \nchanges in the Chilean Constitution and legislation, may affect development plans, production levels  and \ncosts, risks related to financial markets, among others.  \nMt. Holland lithium project, Australia  \nThe Mt. Holland Project is an integrated lithium project in Western Australia consisting of: (i) an open \npit mine and lithium concentrator operation at Mt. Holland, 120 kilometers southeast of Southern Cross, \nand (ii) a lithium hydroxide (LiOH) refinery, located in the town of Kwinana, 26.5 kilometers from the \nport of Fremantle, from where the LiOH will be shipped.  \nThe project is an unincorporated joint venture in which SQM owns 50% and Wesfarmers Limited \n(\"Wesfarmers\"), through a wholly owned subsidiary, owns the remaining 50%, and is managed by \nCovalent Lithium Pty Ltd (\"Covalent\"), an entity 50% owned by SQM and 5 0% owned by Wesfarmers.  \nThe project is accessed overland via Parker Range Road and Marvel Loch -Forrestania road, which is \ncurrently a gravel road. Parker Range Road is connected to Great Eastern Highway, which is a paved \nroad with connectivity to Southern Cross, Kalgoorlie and Pe rth. In addition, the project has air access, \nutilizing a dedicated airstrip on the southern side of the mine.  \nThe project includes:  \n• An open pit mining operation focused on the Earl Grey hard rock lithium deposit at Mt. Holland, \napproximately 100 kilometers south of the town of Southern Cross in Western Australia and 500 \nkilometers east of the city of Perth.  \n• A spodumene concentrator plant located at the Mt. Holland site with a nominal production \ncapacity of 383,000 metric tons per year of dry spodumene concentrate grading 5.5% Li2O.  \n• A refinery under development, located in the Kwinana industrial precinct, approximately 45 \nkilometers south of Perth, with the capacity to produce 50,000 metric tons per year of battery -\ngrade lithium hydroxide (LiOH) product for export worldwide.  \n• The non -process infrastructure (NPI) required to support the Mt. Holland and Kwinana sites, \nincluding roads, buildings, accommodation, and the provision of logistics and utilities.  \nThe rare element pegmatite potential of the Forrestania Greenstone Belt (FGB) was first recognized in \nthe mid -1970s when a small, complex lepidolite -type pegmatite was discovered during nickel \nexploration. This pegmatite produced small amounts of gem -quality tantalum and elbaite (rubellite) and \nberyl (morganite). Narrow pegmat ites with spodumene have been found several kilometers to the north.  \nNo systematic exploration for rare element pegmatites had been carried out in the district since the \ndiscovery of gemmy pegmatite containing rubellite and tantalum in the early 1970s. Following the \nacquisition of the Project from the administrators of Conv ergent Minerals, Kidman Resources Limited \n(\"Kidman Resources\") conducted a high level review of the region leading to the discovery of the Bounty \nand Earl Grey pegmatites.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 133 Exploration by Kidman Resources beginning in 2016 defined numerous occurrences of rare element \npegmatites throughout the FGB. By far the most significant of these corresponds to the Mt. Holland (Earl \nGrey) deposit. Albite -spodumene -type pegmatites have bee n found at Bounty and Blue Vein. Albite -\ntype pegmatites have been tested at Prince of Wales. Spodumene and lepidolite -type complex pegmatites \nhave been determined at Blue Vein, Mt Hope and South Holland (Kidman Resources, 2018).  \nOn September 11, 2017, Kidman Resources Limited (Kidman) and SQM entered into an asset sale \nagreement, whereby SQM acquired its interest in the holdings for a total investment of US$110 million, \nconsisting of an initial payment of US$25 million and a defer red payment of US$85 million, both \npayments subject to certain conditions precedent. All payments were completed in December 2018. \nUnder the asset sale agreement, the parties also agreed to form an unincorporated joint venture to extract \nand process the sp odumene ore into spodumene concentrate or lithium hydroxide. The Mt. Holland joint \nventure was established by the December 21, 2017 unincorporated joint venture agreement between \nSQM Australia and MH Gold, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kidman. Wesfarmers ac quired Kidman in \n2019, resulting in Wesfarmers assuming Kidman's interest in the Mt. Holland joint venture on September \n23, 2019.  \nSQM and Wesfarmers announced an investment decision in February 2021, following the completion of \na feasibility study by Covalent. The project commenced mining activities in the first quarter of 2022, \nwith first ore mined in the fourth quarter of 2022, and  the concentrator completed construction and began \nramping up production in 2023. The refinery is under construction and the completion date is expected \nto be during the first half of 2025.  \nThe Mt. Holland project is focused on the exploitation of the spodumene hosted lithium resource in the \nEarl Grey pegmatite group. The Earl Grey pegmatite group consists of a main tabular pegmatite body \nflanked by numerous smaller dykes at both its roof and  base. The pegmatite field covers an area of up to \n1 x 2 square kilometers and a thickness of up to 100 meters. The pegmatites become progressively \nnarrower and more branching to the south and east of the main pegmatite until even the main body splits \ninto several narrower dikes. Within the pegmatite body, isolated box -rock enclaves are found \nsporadically.  \nThe pegmatites have an approximate strike of 210° to 220° and dip 5° to 15° to the northwest. At their \nwestern margin, the pegmatites appear to be affected by gentle folding. The dip of the pegmatites is \nvariable, with the pegmatite increasing from subhori zontal in the south to 10° to 15° to the northwest \nnorth of the Earl Grey gold deposit.  \nLithium mineralization within fresh pegmatite is zoned and controlled mainly by dominant mineralogy; \nSpodumene and petalite dominated assemblages are enriched compared to altered (cookeite) and Li -free \nassemblages. The Li2O % mineralization is depleted in the weathered pegmatite.  \nExtensive exploration supports the characterization of the Earl Grey pegmatite, as well as the estimation \nof resources and reserves. The exploration conducted is comprised of surface mapping and drilling \ncampaigns conducted on the property, considering tha t the pegmatite does not outcrop in the area. \nExploration was predominantly executed by Kidman since 2016, for discovery and resource definition. \nSince 2020, Covalent has conducted additional diamond drilling for metallurgical sampling, grade \ncontrol drill ing campaigns and definition of orebody geometry improvements in the proposed area of the \ninitial drilling.  \nMost of the exploration drill holes at Earl Grey have been drilled using standard reverse circulation \n(\"RC\") drilling techniques. Diamond drilling comprises 47.6 mm, 50.5 mm, 63.5 mm and 85 mm  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 134 diameter holes, which are drilled for geological, metallurgical and geotechnical purposes. Recoveries for \nreverse circulation drilling range from 70 to 90% in this geological/geomorphological environment. \nRecoveries for diamond drilling are on the order of  95-100%. Recoveries decrease where shear zones or \nother structural disturbances have been crossed. The orientation of the drill holes is at relatively acute \nangles (less than 90º) and, therefore, the intersected length is not considered as a representatio n of the \nactual thickness of the pegmatite; its actual thickness is determined through geological models.  \nResource drilling was initially carried out on wide exploration grids to determine the extent of \nmineralization. This was followed by a 50 by 50 metre grid drilling program to support the resource \nestimate. Through the development of the Project in 2020, t he first stages of the open pit were defined \nand the drill program was designed for grade control based on higher density and geostatistical criteria. \nThis information provides the mine design during the initial years of commissioning and supports the \ncurrent resource and reserve definition.  \nFacilities  \nThe Mt. Holland project is an integrated lithium project in Western Australia consisting of (i) an open \npit mine at the Earl Grey hard rock lithium deposit and a spodumene concentrator comprised of a DMS \nand flotation circuits, 120 kilometers southeast of Southern Cross, and (ii) a lithium hydroxide (LiOH) \nrefinery, located in the town of Kwinana, 26.5 kilometers from the Port of Fremantle, from where the \nbattery grade LiOH product will be shipped. The concentrator at Mt. Holland has a nominal production \ncapacity of 383,000 dry tonnes per year of concentrate with a grade of 5.5 percent lithium oxide which \nmatches the refinery's feed requirements. The Kwinana refinery has the capacity to produce 50,000 tons \nper year of lithium hydroxide.  \nThe Mt. Holland project is focused on mining and beneficiation of spodumene reserves in the Earl Grey \ngroup of pegmatites. The deposit consists of a main body of thick tabular pegmatites, which become \nprogressively narrower and branch south and east from t he main pegmatite until the main body splits \ninto several narrower dykes. Sporadically, isolated box rock enclaves are found within the pegmatite \nbody.  \nThe first ore from the pit was mined in 2022 and the concentrator started commissioning in the third \nquarter of 2023. First concentrate production from both circuits was achieved in the last quarter of 2023 \nand the first shipment of spodumene concentrate i s expected in the first half of 2024. As of December \n2023, construction of the concentrator plant has been completed and the refinery is under construction.  \nThe following table provides a summary of our production facilities in Australia as of December 31, \n2023:  \n \nType of installation  Approximate \nsize \n(hectares)(1) Nominal production \ncapacity (  \nthousands of metric \ntons/year)  Weighted \naverage \n(years)(2) Gross book value \n(US$ millions)(2) \nMt.

No material \nchanges since last update.  \n(2) Please note that some rounding errors may occur.  \n \nA mineral resource and mineral reserve depletion exercise was completed by Covalent and reviewed by \nSQM. Mineral resource depletion was completed by interrogating the 2022 mineral resource model with \nthe final topographic surface of the mine surveyed on De cember 27, 2023, then 5 days of production to \nDecember 31, 2023 were subtracted from the remaining resource. It was found that there was no \ndepletion of the previously reported mineral resources, excluding mineral reserves.  \nOre reserve depletion was completed by interrogating the 2022 reserve model with the year -end mine \narea and validating it with material movements. Ore stockpiles totaling 0.2 metric tons were accounted \nfor as part of the ore reserve inventory, resulting in  the depletion of 0.2 metric tons of reserves, of which \n0.1 metric tons were attributable to SQM. Some additional material was processed that was outside of \nthe 2022 reserve model. This was a combination of additional ore material identified during grade c ontrol \nmodeling and mining processes and the use of some transition material for concentrator commissioning.  \nAs a result of a depletion exercise, the proven and probable mineral reserves of the Mt. Holland lithium \nproject attributable to SQM totaled 10.7 million metric tons and 31.2 million metric tons at December \n31, 2023, respectively. The Mt. Holland lithium p roject's measured, indicated and inferred mineral \nresources, excluding reserves, of 13.5 million metric tons, 30.5 million metric tons and 3.5 million tons \nat December 31, 2023, respectively, remained unchanged from the amounts at December 31, 2021.  \nThe information presented in the tables above (Mt.

Mr. Fock acted \nas project manager during the preparation of the technical report summary for the Mt. Holland project. \nMr. Fock is an employee of SQM.  \nMining rights  \nThe Mt. Holland lithium mine and concentrator operation is spread over three main mining properties \n(M77/1065, M77/1066 and M77/1080), as well as exploration licenses, general purpose licenses and \nmiscellaneous licenses (project properties), covering an approximate area of 4,606 hectares.  \nThe majority of the project properties are currently registered in equal shares in the name of MH Gold, \na subsidiary of Wesfarmers, and SQM Australia, a subsidiary of SQM. The project is a joint venture, in \nwhich SQM owns 50% and Wesfarmers owns the remain ing 50% (the \"Mt. Holland Joint Venture\"), and \nis managed by Covalent, an entity owned 50% by SQM and 50% by Wesfarmers. Covalent is not the \nregistered owner or applicant of the project properties under the Western Australian Mining Act (WA).  \nTransportation and Storage Facilities   \nOur products are transported by trucks that are operated by dedicated third parties under long -term \ncontracts. Moreover, we have our own port and storage facilities for the transportation and handling of \nfinished products and consumables.  \nOur main raw material production and storage facilities are the Nueva Victoria, Coya Sur and Salar de \nAtacama facilities in Chile and Mt. Holland in Australia. Other facilities include our Lithium Chemical \nPlant located near the city of Antofagasta in Chil e, the Mt. Holland lithium hydroxide plant, which is \ncurrently under construction in Kwinana, Western Australia, as well as the Tocopilla Port terminal, \nwhich is the main facility for the storage and dispatch of our bulk and packaged potassium chloride \n(MO P), nitrates and lithium carbonate products.   \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 138 In Chile, finished nitrate products are produced at our Coya Sur facilities and then transported by truck \nto the Port of Tocopilla terminal where they are stored and shipped in bulk or packaged in polypropylene \nbags, polyethylene or polypropylene bags. The  latter can also be transported and stored at an alternative \nport (Mejillones) for subsequent shipment.  \nPotassium chloride is produced at our Salar de Atacama facilities and transported by truck to either the \nTocopilla port terminal, the Coya Sur facilities or the alternative port of Mejillones for shipment. The \nproduct transported to Coya Sur is an intermed iate product used as raw material for the production of \npotassium nitrate. The product transported to the Port of Tocopilla or Mejillones is a final product that \nwill be shipped or transported to the client or affiliate. The saltpetre raw material for the production of \npotassium nitrate at Coya Sur is currently produced at Nueva Victoria.  \nLithium chloride solution, containing a high concentration of boron, produced at our Salar de Atacama \nfacilities, is transported to the lithium carbonate plant at our Lithium chemical facilities area, where \nfinished lithium carbonate is produced. Some of t he lithium carbonate is supplied to the adjacent lithium \nhydroxide plant where finished lithium hydroxide is produced. These two products are packaged in \ncontainers of different characteristics such as polyethylene bags, multilayer FIBC big-bag or \npolyprop ylene, stored in the same facilities and protected in warehouses. Subsequently, they are \nconsolidated in containers that are transported in trucks to a transit warehouse or directly to port terminals \nfor subsequent shipment. The port terminals currently us ed are capable of receiving container ships and \nare located in Antofagasta, Mejillones and Iquique. Lithium carbonate can also be transported in \npackaged form either to the Port of Tocopilla or to an alternative port (Mejillones) to be shipped in \nfractiona ted form.  \nIodine obtained from the same caliche used for nitrate production is processed, packaged and stored \nexclusively at the Pedro de Valdivia and Nueva Victoria facilities. The containers used for iodine are \npolypropylene drums and FIBC big bags with an interna l polyethylene bag and oxygen barrier, which \nare consolidated in containers and shipped by truck to port terminals suitable for handling, located mainly \nin Antofagasta, Mejillones and Iquique. They are then shipped to different markets in container ships o r \nby truck to Santiago where iodine derivatives are produced at Ajay -SQM Chile's plants. Drums and \nmaxibags can also be transported by flat ramps to an alternative port (Mejillones) to be shipped in break \nbulk format.  \nIn Australia, production of spodumene concentrate at the Mt. Holland mine commenced in 2023. Pending \ncompletion of the lithium hydroxide refinery at Kwinana, the concentrate will be trucked to a storage \nfacility at Bunbury, approximately 500 kilometers wes t of the Mt. Holland mine. At Bunbury, the product \nis distributed to the SQM and Wesfarmers joint venture partners to follow their individual shipping and \nmarketing plans. For overland logistics from the Mt. Holland mine to the port of Bunbury, bulk haulag e \noperators are responsible for transporting the spodumene concentrate by road haulage trucks. The \nhaulage operator is certified by Bureau Veritas for the provision of bulk transport and storage services, \ntransport of controlled dangerous goods waste, oper ation and maintenance of heavy vehicles in \naccordance with the requirements of the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO. 45001:2018.  \nIn Chile, we own and operate the Tocopilla port terminal. Our subsidiary, Servicios Integrales de \nTránsitos y Transferencias S.A. (SIT), operates facilities for the shipment of products and the delivery \nof certain raw materials based on renewable concessio ns granted by the Chilean regulatory authorities, \nprovided that the facilities are used in accordance with the authorization granted and we pay an annual \nconcession fee. The facilities include a truck weighing machine that confirms the entry of product int o \nthe port and transfers it to the various storage areas, a piezometer within the shipping system for bulk  \n6 OUR BUSINESS     \n 139 product loading onto vessels, a 40 -ton capacity crane for loading sealed product onto vessels and a nitrate \nblending facility.  \nThe storage facilities consist of a system of six silos, with a total storage capacity of 55,000 metric tons, \nand a mixed storage area of open and covered warehouses with a total storage capacity of approximately \n250,000 metric tons. In addition, to meet f uture storage needs, we will continue to make investments in \naccordance with the investment plan defined by management. Products are also bagged at the Port of \nTocopilla terminal facilities, where bagging capacity is established by two bagging machines, on e for \npolypropylene FIBC sacks and big bags and the other for polyethylene FFS. Products packaged in \nTocopilla can be shipped later at the same port or can also be consolidated in trucks or containers for \nsubsequent shipment to customers by land or sea via  containers from other ports, mainly located in \nAntofagasta, Mejillones, and Iquique.  \nFor the transport of bulk products, the conveyor belt system extends along the coast to deliver the \nproducts directly to the hatches of the bulk carriers. The rated loading capacity of this shipping system \nis 1,200 tons per hour. Packaged product is transported using the same bulk vessels using unpowered \nbarges located on the dock and loaded by a 40 -ton capacity crane from the terminal at the Port of \nTocopilla. Subsequently, they are towed and unloaded by ship cranes to the respective warehouses.  \nWe normally contract bulk cargo vessels to transfer product from the terminal at the Port of Tocopilla to \nour facilities around the world or directly to customers, who, in certain cases, use their own contracted \nvessels for delivery.  \nTocopilla's processes related to the reception, handling, storage and shipment of bulk/packaged nitrates \nproduced at Coya Sur are certified by the external organization TÜV -Rheinland under the ISO 9001:2015 \nquality standard. The Port of Tocopilla also hold s Responsible Care, ISO 14000 and Ecoport \ncertifications.  \n6.5 SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATES  \n \nInformation on SQM's main subsidiaries and associates is presented in detail in Appendix 3.  \n \n 7 SUPPLIER  MANAGEMENT     140 7. SUPPLIER S MANAGEMENT  \n7.1 PAYMENT TO SUPPLIERS  \n \nThere are corporate procedures that address the payment of suppliers, for example, with respect to the \npayment of purchase orders, it is mentioned that it must be made within 30 days, unless a different term \nis expressly established. In any case, our policy is to guarantee timely payment to our suppliers of goods \nand services. On average, payment is made 45 days after the supplier submits its invoice and it is received \nby SQM.  \n \nPayment dates are calculated from the date the invoice arrives at SQM, duly drawn up and with the \nrequested attachments. In the event that, due to omission or error of any information in the invoice, \nmodifications will be required and the issuance of a cre dit note for the total amount of the invoice to be \ncorrected, partial credit notes cannot be accepted. Due to this, the deadlines are interrupted until the \npresentation of the new invoice correctly prepared.  \n \nThis is counted from the date of receipt of the invoice or the date of receipt of the goods by SQM, \nwhichever is later. Invoices indicate the payment conditions stipulated in the respective agreements and \npurchase orders, as well as discounts for prompt pa yment in effect at the date of issue.  \n \nThe Company has a list of strategic suppliers, under which an action plan is being developed to mitigate \nrisks according to their critical variables, where it could be reviewed according to their criticality if it \nmakes sense to set special deadlines for a ny of these suppliers. Given the above, we are working on an \ninternal definition to segregate critical and non -critical suppliers.  \n \nFor foreign suppliers, a condition is generally used that establishes that payment will be made within the \nterms agreed with the supplier, which depending on the particular case may be more or less than the term \nestablished in the procedure. By process, im port purchases are supported by an advance payment and \nthen against the shipping document the payment of the outstanding balance is agreed, this on average is \n15 days.  \n \nFor those national or international suppliers with whom SQM has a stronger commercial relationship, \npayments are allowed once the goods are received at our warehouses or points of destination.  \n \nAt the company level, we do not have a calendar days target, however, we promote good practices for \ntimely payments respecting good faith negotiations between both parties and based on what is indicated \nin the corporate procedure. Therefore, in our operati ons in northern Chile we have set a medium -term \ngoal that in general all payments should be made within a maximum of 30 days from the presentation of \nthe invoice.  \n \nAs a good practice, in order to encourage the development of local suppliers (Tarapacá Region and \nAntofagasta Region) we have defined cash payment for them. This same criterion has been applied to \nthose service providers that we have preliminarily categori zed as critical, regardless of their place of \nresidence.  \n \nTo achieve these objectives and in line with our Sustainability policy, we request and control that our \nservice providers keep updated and certify compliance with their labor obligations through an external \ncertifying company, validated for this purpose.  \n  \n7 SUPPLIER  MANAGEMENT     141 SQM has an ARTIKOS platform where contractors can monitor the payment of their invoices free of \ncharge.   \n(https://art -p-ptk.artikos.cl/SIAS/web_SQM/HomeProv.asp#)  \n \nWe have no amounts of interest in arrears nor do we have any agreements registered in the Registry of \nAgreements with Exceptional Payment Terms of the Ministry of Economy.  \n \nPayment to Suppliers 2023  \n \n  Type of Supplier  Calendar Days Tranche  \nUp to 30 days  Between 31 and \n60 days  More than 60 \ndays  \nNo. of Invoices Paid  National  105.302  1.489  1.804  \nForeign  2.604 2.419  1.304  \nTotal  131.346  3.908  3.108  \nTotal Amount in Ch$ \nmillion  \n(millions of CLP)  National  4.078.573  13.618  4.885  \nForeign  519.439  65.053  41.425  \nTotal  4.596.012  78.671  46.310  \nN° of Suppliers  National  3.624  322 315 \nForeign  2.544  561 394 \nTotal  6.168  883 709 \n \n7.2 SUPPLIER EVALUATION  \n \nAt SQM we are aware that, as a multinational company with operations around the world, we have the \nresponsibility to respect human rights and our commitments established in the company's Sustainability, \nEthics and Human Rights Policy, even beyond what the laws require u s to do, which is a minimum \nstandard for our actions.  \n \nThroughout our history, we have worked to improve (i) our production quality, (ii) fair treatment, (iii) \nenvironmental protection, and (iv) unrestricted respect for human rights, subjecting ourselves to the \nhighest international standards. We have formally  adhered to the UN Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights and the \"protect, respect and remedy\" framework they enshrine, adopting them as our \nown. We seek to extend this commitment to human rights throughout our supply chain to ensure \nresponsible sourcing.  \n \nSQM has developed a responsible sourcing program aligned with the five pillars that form the core of \nour corporate sustainability strategy: 1) ethics and corporate governance, 2) our workers, 3) value chain, \n4) environment and sustainable development, and 5) communities. In line with these pillars, we aim to \nensure that our suppliers understand and are able to meet our expectations in order to maintain our high \nstandards. Accordingly, we have published our Responsible Sourcing Policy, which outlines our val ue \nchain requirements.  \n \nWe expect all suppliers with whom we engage to comply with applicable legislation and to share our \nsustainability commitments in their own businesses. We urge all of our suppliers, which include inputs, \nservices, consultancies, intermediaries, among others , that provide services to SQM to:  \n• Respect the human rights of their workers  \n• Take care of the environment  \n• Protect health and safety  \n• Prioritize ethics and integrity in your business   \n7 SUPPLIER  MANAGEMENT     142 • Promote fair treatment of their own employees  \n \nTo this end, in concrete terms we seek to ensure at least that:  \n• Ensure compliance with our code of ethics.  \n• Know and understand our policies  \n• Conduct a sustainability self -assessment on an annual basis.  \n• Commit to provide further information if requested and/or participate in additional validation.  \n• Apply corrective actions if necessary.  \n \nIn our Responsible Sourcing Policy, we have defined that there are certain risks throughout the supply \nchain which, if they occur, imply a material breach of the Policy, but also of other SQM corporate \npolicies. In this sense, substantial non -compliance is  understood as incurring in a serious violation of \nhuman rights or engaging in intolerable conduct that represents a threat to the rule of law or human rights. \nIn these situations, SQM may suspend or terminate the commercial relationship with the supplier that \nhas engaged in such conduct.  \n \nWe are aware that throughout the supply chain of activities related to the extraction of minerals, as well \nas in their transportation or trade, there is a greater susceptibility to certain abuses that constitute serious \nhuman rights violations that companies must avoid and commit to eradicate. In this sense, it is considered \na serious violation of human rights:  \n \n• Incurring in any form of child labor in accordance with Convention No. 182 of the \nInternational Labor Organization (ILO), ratified by Chile in 2000.  \n \n• Adopting or tolerating practices of forced labor or any other type of modern slavery, including \nwork under threat and any work for which the individual has not volunteered.  \n \n• Any form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  \n \n• Other abusive treatment, such as widespread sexual violence and other serious human rights \nviolations.  \n \n• Committing or participating in the commission of war crimes or other serious violations of \ninternational humanitarian law, crimes against humanity or genocide.  \n \nLikewise, understanding that mineral extractive activities, such as those carried out by SQM, present \nrisks regarding the possible involvement of non -state armed groups along the supply chain, which \nrepresent a threat to the rule of law and human rights, S QM will not tolerate any type of direct or indirect \nsupport to these non -state armed groups. Direct or indirect support may include, but is not limited to, \nobtaining minerals, making payments, providing logistical assistance or equipment, performing acts o r \ncontracts on their behalf, among others.  \n \nIn this sense, they are considered intolerable conduct:  \n \n• Directly or indirectly support non -state armed groups that illegally control work sites and \noperations, or otherwise exercise control over transportation routes or mineral \ncommercialization points.  \n  \n7 SUPPLIER  MANAGEMENT     143 • Directly or indirectly supporting non -state armed groups that illegally collect taxes or extort at \naccess points to work sites or operations along transport routes or at points where minerals are \ncommercialized.  \n \n• Directly or indirectly supporting non -state armed groups that extort money from intermediaries, \nexporters or international traders.  \n \nIn turn, in order to verify what is established in our policies, we have developed a supplier evaluation \nmechanism that considers 6 categories:  \n \n \n \nIn the year 2023, the second Self -Assessment was carried out based on the Sustainability criteria, in \nwhich 71 suppliers participated. Of these, 7 were entered through the CAHRAS List procedure, which \nis requested by the Compliance area, to all suppliers that belonged  to areas affected by conflicts and high \nrisk. In addition, 52 suppliers were invited to participate by SQM, and 12 were identified as potential \nsuppliers for SQM who also participated in the internal evaluation by SQM.  \n \nSupplier Evaluation  \n \n  Type of \nSupplier  2023  \nN° of Suppliers Prospects to be Analyzed1 National  58 \nForeign  13 \nTotal  71 \nN° of Suppliers Evaluated  National  58 \nForeign  13 \nTotal  71 \n% of Suppliers Evaluated  National  100%  \nForeign  100%  \nTotal  100%  \nTotal Supplier Purchases (in Ch$ million)  National   4.097.076  \nForeign   623.917  \nTotal   4.720.993  \nTotal Purchases from Suppliers Evaluated (in Ch$ \nmillion)  National   305.153  \nForeign  43.001  \nTotal   348.154  \n% of Purchases from Evaluated Suppliers  National  8% \nForeign  6% \nTotal  7% \n1 Number of suppliers that would have been analyzed during the period.  \n \nWithin our evaluation methodology, we categorize our suppliers in 5 categories depending on the \ncompliance with the criteria explained above. Thus, the \"A\" qualification corresponds to compliance \nover 80% of what is expected by SQM, \"B\" between 60 -80%, \"C\"  between 40 -60%, \"D\" between 20 -\n40% and \"E\" between 0 -20%.  \n Derechos \nHumanosResponsabilidad \nSocial \nEmpresarialÉtica del \nNegocioGestión de \nCalidadSeguridad y \nSalud \nOcupacionalMedio \nAmbiente \n7 SUPPLIER  MANAGEMENT     144 The results of SQM's internal suppliers (52 suppliers) that completed the Self -Assessment correspond to \nan overall average score of 68.2% in which the highest categories correspond to business ethics and \nRespect for human rights, while the lowest categorie s correspond to environment and corporate social \nresponsibility. Of the 52 suppliers evaluated, 17 obtained category \"A\", while 28 obtained category \"B\" \nand 7 obtained category \"C\".  \n \nThis provides us with a baseline to continue advancing in sustainability by working directly with our \nsuppliers to further align our criteria established in the program.  \n \n \n \n \n   \n8 INDICATORS    145 8. INDICATORS  \n8.1 LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  \nIn relation to customers  \nLaw 19,496 on Consumer Rights Protection does not apply to SQM's lines of business in Chile and \nsubsidiaries, as long as the sale of products is not made to the final consumer. Notwithstanding the above, \nthe Company has procedures in place to ensure that t he products it manufactures and sells comply with \ncurrent regulations in all countries where it operates and in each of the areas described in Section 6.1, \nLegal and Regulatory Framework.  \nIn this context, during 2023, the Company has not been subject to customer -related fines in any of its \nbusiness lines.  \nIn relation to employees  \nSQM has the following procedures in place to prevent and detect non -compliance with regulations \nregarding the rights of its workers:  \n• Internal Rules of Hygiene and Safety Order;  \n• Procedure \"Identification, merger and verification of the SGIGC regulatory framework\";  \n• Procedure \"Identification of legal requirements applicable to occupational safety and \nhealth\";  \n• Legal Alerts on regulatory changes reported by the Legal Vice -Presidency to the areas;  \n• Procedures for the prevention, detection, reporting and follow -up of labor and sexual \nharassment;  \n• Procedure for handling complaints regarding unfair or discriminatory situations.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nDuring 2023 the companies were subject to three administrative sanctions (fines) issued by the Labor \nDirectorate, two of which have been executed and paid for a total amount of CLP $9,591,500 and one is \npending.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nIn addition, in 2023, the companies were 16 lawsuits for the Protection of Fundamental Rights, of which \n10 belong to the Nitrates Iodine Division, where seven of them have been terminated through settlements \nor conciliations and three are pending; and 6 belong to the Potassium Lithium Division, where 2 have \nbeen terminated through settlements or conciliations and 4 are pending.  \nIn relation to the environment  \nThe protection of the environment, respect for human rights and, in general, the impact on sustainability \nare a permanent concern of the company, both in its production processes and throughout the supply \nchain. This commitment is supported by the principl es stated in the Company's Sustainable \nDevelopment, Ethics and Human Rights policy.  \n \nWithin each of the Company's operational areas there is an Environmental Management that is in charge \nof complying with environmental regulations. The Company carries out environmental follow -up and  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 146 monitoring plans in all its operations based on specialized scientific studies. The monitoring of relevant \nvariables defined for each project makes it possible to verify the status of, for example, vegetation, flora, \nfauna, and aquatic biota in the ecosyst ems to be protected. In turn, the monitoring plans are supported \nby a wide control network with monitoring points such as wells and weather stations, satellite images, \nplots for recording the state of vegetation and fauna, among others. The activities incl uded in these plans \nare regularly reported to the authorities in accordance with the resolutions approving the different \nprojects of the SQM Group. In the specific case of the Salar de Atacama, SQM has implemented an \nonline platform (www.sqmsenlinea.com  ), which allows anyone to access all the environmental \ninformation that the Company collects, according to its commitments.   \n \nLikewise, in the case of Lithium and Potassium operations, there is an Environmental Compliance \nStrategy, which structures the process of identification, registration, promotion, assistance and \nverification of compliance, as well as monitoring and reportin g of applicable environmental \nrequirements. There is a matrix of applicable environmental requirements, which details all the \nrequirements and commitments established in environmental qualification resolutions and applicable \nregulations, as well as annual operational compliance programs by site, which contain a schedule of \nactivities for assistance and verification of applicable environmental requirements. During 2023, the first \npilot program was implemented, while during 2024, performance and risk indicato rs associated with the \nresults of its implementation will be generated.  \n \nIn this context, the Company's environmental monitoring of the systems where it operates is supported \nby numerous studies that have integrated various scientific efforts of prestigious national and \ninternational research centers, such as the Spanish Nation al Research Council (CSIC) and the \nUniversidad Católica del Norte.  \n \nIn addition, as part of the environmental studies carried out by the Company for its new projects, \nimportant work is being carried out to record pre -Hispanic and historical cultural heritage, as well as the \nprotection of heritage sites, in accordance with current legislation. These actions have been carried out \nespecially around María Elena (ME) and the Nueva Victoria (NV) site. This effort is being accompanied \nby actions to disseminate information to the community and to enhance the value of sites of inter est. \n \nWe are able to identify those aspects of environmental relevance in each project and evaluate their \npotential impacts, which requires a high level of knowledge of the functioning of the ecosystems in the \narea of influence in which our projects are develope d, in order to be able to manage and respond in \nadvance to any potential impact. Each of our projects is submitted to the Environmental Impact \nAssessment System. As of December 2023, we have environmental authorizations for 70 projects, of \nwhich 15 corresp ond to Environmental Impact Studies and 55 to Environmental Impact Statements.  \n \nIn 2023, the Superintendency of the Environment carried out a programmed inspection of the Tente en \nel Aire Project at Faena Nueva Victoria, with the participation of CONADI, SAG and SMA. \nCommitments with communities, biotic and paleontological heritage co mponents were reviewed.  \n \nDuring 2023, Salar de Atacama received a visit from the Directorate General of Water, which inspected \nthe catchments in Salar de Atacama as part of its annual inspection program, not verifying extraction in \nexcess of the rights granted, nor any violation o f the Water Code. On November 10, 2023, the Directorate \nGeneral of Water closed the associated inspection files. Also, an inspection was received from the \nNational Geology and Mining Service, who reviewed various aspects related to mining safety, as well \nas the applicability of permits under the jurisdiction of that service with respect to a process associated \nwith the production of lithium sulfate.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 147 The Lithium Chemical Plant was visited twice by the Antofagasta Health Seremi, the first time to verify \nthe drinking water supply system, and the second time to verify the conditions of the boilers, in \naccordance with the provisions of D.S. N°10/2012, of t he Ministry of Health.  \n \nIn addition, our Coya Sur and María Elena operations were audited by the Superintendency of the \nEnvironment, SERNAGEOMIN and the Antofagasta Health Seremi. The audited matters correspond to \nEnvironmental Classification Resolutions (RCA's), Declaration of E missions by D.S. N° 138, \nmonitoring stations by Supreme Decree (D.S.) N° 61, PTAS Plants, María Elena Decontamination Plan, \nand Closure Plans. In addition, the Pedro de Valdivia mine was also inspected by the Superintendencia \ndel Medio Ambiente (SMA) for R CA. \n \nDuring 2023, Puerto Tocopilla was audited by the Environmental Superintendency under the \nDecontamination Plan.  \n \nIn relation to our operations in Nueva Victoria, in February 2019, the Environmental Superintendency \napproved a compliance program, which is currently being executed, suspending the sanctioning process \ninitiated in 2016. This decision was confirmed by the Antofagasta Environmental Court in October 2020. \nIn compliance with the commitment, in July 2020, we submitted the Environmental Impact Study for the \nproject \"Partial modification of the reinjection system in the Llamara puquios\". The project was approved \nin October 2023, and concluded with an Indigenous Consultation process with agreement with \nTamentica, Quillagua and Huatacondo communities (Final Agreement Protocol).  \n \nIn Salar de Atacama, the compliance program that had been approved by the Superintendency of the \nEnvironment was rendered ineffective by the Environmental Court in December 2019. SQM submitted \nin November 2020 a new version of the compliance program, addre ssing the observations made by the \nSuperintendency. Finally, Compliance Program was approved by Res. Ex. N°38/F -041-2016 of August \n29, 2022 leaving without effect the provisional measures imposed and the sanctioning one. As of \nDecember 31, 2023, 20% of the  actions implemented and 80% of the actions in progress were achieved.  \n \nPart of the commitments made in the Salar de Atacama Compliance Program are to implement \nparticipatory monitoring for the Hydrogeological Environmental Monitoring Plan, design and implement \na community training program associated with environmental monitor ing, gradually reduce the \nmaximum brine extraction limit to 822 l/s as of 2027, a little less than 50% of the authorized extraction, \nand reduce the total industrial water flow to 120 l/s, equivalent to a reduction of 50% of the authorized \nflow.  \n \nFinally, SQM has closure plans for all of its production sites approved by the corresponding authority, \nwhich include criteria and measures in accordance with current regulations.  \n   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 148 Environmental Penalties, Fines, Programs and Remediation Plans 2023  \n N° \nSanctions Enforced  0 \nTotal Environmental Fines  0 \nApproved Environmental Compliance Programs1 2 \nEnvironmental Compliance Programs Satisfactorily Executed2 N/A \nEnvironmental Remediation Plans Submitted  0 \nEnvironmental Remediation Plans Satisfactorily Executed3 N/A \nN/A: not applicable  \n1.

The environmental compliance plans are still being executed; therefore, it is not yet possible to know if they have been sati sfactorily \nimplemented.  \n3. Since we do not have environmental remediation plans, this question does not apply to us.  \n \nFree Competition  \nThe Company has a Free Competition Policy, as well as a Protocol on the delivery and use of sensitive \ninformation related to the Lithium business. Within the framework established by SQM's Code of Ethics, \nthe company's commitment to respect free competitio n is established, therefore, the respective Policy \naims to establish guidelines and expected behaviors from employees, in order to respect the laws of free \ncompetition worldwide.  \nIn this regard, all directors, officers and employees are expected to understand and respect antitrust laws \nand to be aware that failure to comply with them could result in substantial fines for SQM, litigation and, \nin some countries, fines or criminal pen alties for directors, officers or employees involved in such \nconduct.  Violation of antitrust laws may also result in unenforceable commercial agreements and \nsignificant damage to the reputation of individuals, as well as SQM.  \nFor each case, the Company's Antitrust Policy establishes rules of conduct that must never be executed, \nand other issues that must first be discussed with SQM's Ethics and Compliance Management. On the \nother hand, this Policy contains best practices in com pliance matters, which, if properly applied, will \nsubstantially reduce the chances that antitrust laws will be violated. This Policy is based on two \nfundamental golden rules: i) never enter into anti -competitive agreements or contracts, and ii) never \nabuse  a dominant market position.  \nDuring 2023 SQM had no enforceable sanctions in this area.  \n \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 149 Others  \nSQM has a Crime Prevention Model that is certified until September 2023, which establishes the \nmechanisms for prevention, detection and response to situations that may represent the company's \ncriminal liability. In terms of prevention, the company has a Co de of Ethics that establishes a standard \nof conduct expected for all employees.  \nIn order to create an environment of control, the Company has various corporate policies and procedures \nthat reinforce its adherence to a culture of integrity. On the other hand, a solid training and \ncommunication program is carried out to publicize the co mpliance program, as well as to raise awareness \nof the need for its full follow -up and implementation. Regarding the detection of cases, among others, \nthe company has a Whistleblower Channel that allows both employees and third parties to report possible \nnon-compliance with the company's policies and guidelines. (Details of all these guidelines can be found \nin Section 3, Corporate Governance).  \nDuring 2023, SQM did not record any enforceable sanctions in this area.  \n \n8.2 SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS BY INDUSTRY TYPE  \n \nAccording to the Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS), SASB -VRF, which provides certain \nmetrics to measure the performance of companies in different industries, SQM was classified as a \nchemical industry.  \nConsidering the scope and nature of SQM's business activities, this Report and section respond to the \nChemicals Industry Standard indicators.  \nThe topics relevant to the chemical industry that are included in SASB -VRF and will be reported in this \nsection are: greenhouse gas emissions; air quality; energy management; water management; hazardous \nwaste management; community relations; workforce heal th and safety; product design for use -phase \nefficiency; chemicals management for safety and environmental protection; genetically modified \norganisms; management of the legal and regulatory environment; operational safety, emergency \npreparedness and respons e; and activity parameters.  \n \nGreenhouse gas emissions  \n \nIndicators  \n \nRT-CH-110a.1. Scope 1 global gross emissions, percentage covered by emission limitation \nregulations.  \n2.- RT-CH-110a.2. Analysis of the long - and short -term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, \nemission reduction targets and analysis of the results in relation to these targets.  \nOur products are used in industries that are fundamental to human development and people's well -being. \nTherefore, we have defined very ambitious goals in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, \nconsidering scope 1 and 2 emissions and incorporati ng some of the categories for scope 3 emissions. \nThese goals are reflected in our Sustainability Plan, where we have set ourselves greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction targets, such as, for example, aiming to be carbon neutral for lithium and potassium \nchlor ide by 2030, and for all our products by 2040, taking 2019 as the base year, which implies a 90% \nreduction and 10% offset of emissions by 2040.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 150  \nThe main lines of work related to emissions are as follows:  \n \n• Mitigation through the quantification of our GHG emissions according to international \nmethodologies and periodically verified, in search of internal management in each of our \nproduction sites to meet the reduction goals committed in our sustainability stra tegy. Our \nmanagement includes the identification, evaluation and implementation of opportunities to \nreduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, as well as their periodic follow -up. \n• Adaptation of our operations, production and logistics processes according to the specific needs \nand risks of each project, incorporating climate change within the factors of their periodic \nevaluation, in order to identify, evaluate and successfully manage  possible impacts of the \ngrowing effects of climate change.  \n• Generation management under the criteria of quantification, characterization, treatment and \nreduction of emissions, according to current environmental regulations.  \n• Continuous search for alternatives to minimize the generation of emissions.  \nWe monitor emissions in all of our operations through a detailed prediction of the environmental effects \nidentified, the installation and implementation of abatement equipment, and adequate monitoring of \nemissions.  \n \nWe have weather stations, which are essential for monitoring solar evaporation processes in operations. \nIn addition, at SQM we manage environmental monitoring plans and as part of these, isokinetic \nmeasurements are taken at the chimney outlets of equipment  that are part of the production process, such \nas dryers and boilers. Our work during the period has focused on reducing our emissions per product.  \n \nSQM estimates the total Carbon Footprint associated with the sum of its production processes and also \nseparately for several of its products. The estimation of emissions is carried out under the standards \nindicated by the IPCC Guidelines for National Green house Gas Inventories (2006), the GHG Protocol, \nISO 14064 on Greenhouse Gases and ISO 14040 on Life Cycle Analysis.  The factors used for electrical \nenergy correspond to those published on the National Energy Commission's website. Factors are used \naccordin g to the Electric System with which the company has a contract.  \n \nThe GHG estimation considers from the mineral extraction processes to obtaining the finished product \nat the port. Regarding Scope 3, 4 of the 15 categories defined by the GHG Protocol are estimated: \npurchased goods and services, upstream cargo transportati on, people movement and downstream cargo \ntransportation.  \n \nEmissions reported are under financial control, gases included are: CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O. It is worth \nmentioning that our emissions are not covered by a tax or cap & trade, however, in Chile we have a tax \nof US$5/tCO 2 and we are already seeing changes by modifying the tax threshold that currently affects \nfacilities with equipment with more than 50 MW thermal as installed capacity. Under this criteria, in \n2023, SQM paid approximately US$360 thousand, which corresponds t o emissions from the Coya Sur \nboiler . A po tential risk is that all of our emissions will pay this tax in the future. Emissions of the \nfollowing gases are not included in the calculation: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons \n(PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).  \n \nIn 2023, total GHG emissions were 1,608,647 tCO 2 eq. broken down into 315,260 tCO 2 eq (Scope 1), \n532,482 tCO 2 eq (Scope 2) and 760,905 tCO 2 eq (Scope 3). Currently, the 8.6% increase in emissions is \ndue to capacity expansions carried out by the Company.  \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 151 Greenhouse Gas Emissions  \nType of Scope  Metrics  Gases \nIncluded  2023  2022  2021  \nDirect GHG Emissions (Scope  1) tCO 2 eq CO2, CH4, \nN2O  315.260  300.298  286.562  \nIndirect GHG Emissions (Scope 2)  tCO 2 eq CO2, CH4, \nN2O  532.482  508.076  509.108  \nOther Indirect GHG Emissions (Scope 3)  tCO 2 eq CO2, CH4, \nN2O  760.905  673.113  521.065  \nTotal Emissions  (1, 2 and 3)  tCO 2 eq CO2, CH4, \nN2O  1.608.647  1.481.487  1.316.735  \nNote: CO2 - carbon dioxide, CH4 - methane, N2O - nitrogen oxide.  \nCarbon Price  \nHow is it determined?  \nSQM has set an internal price for carbon dioxide \nemissions at US$15 for each ton of carbon dioxide \nemitted.  \nThe price was determined considering the analysis of \nemission reduction alternatives through a marginal \nabatement curve where the cost per unit abated for our \noperations was determined to be close to US$10 -15 \nper ton.  \nIn addition, the current green tax system (SIV) and its \nfuture change of criteria from a technological one \n(boilers and turbines) to an emissions one (cut -off \nthreshold of 25 kCO2e) were considered.  \nOther international regulations have also been \nintegrated into the price, such as the European Union's \nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), \nwhich will tax imports of various goods produced \noutside the EU, including fertilizers. Analyzing the \npotentia l affected emissions projected for each SQM \noperation plus the Company's sustainability \nobjectives.  How is it handled?  \nThe internal price on emissions is used as a criterion in the \nevaluation of the different types of projects to be executed \nin the calendar year, to promote and enhance those \nalternatives that are more sustainable, i.e. that have a \nlower impact on emissions , and that, eventually, are more \ncostly without the inclusion of this internal tax.  \nDuring 2023, we carried out a number of  initiatives that are in line with our greenhouse gas reduction \ntargets, which are mentioned below:  \n \nGiven that we are a key player in the industry, leading the production and refinement of lithium to meet \nthe growing global need, which allows us to contemplate challenges that are key to advancing towards \nthe development of electromobility. In this sense,  we are taking another very important step towards \ncarbon neutrality and zero emissions. This time, we are walking the road together with our strategic  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 152 partners Excon, incorporating the first electric front loader to our operations in Salar de Atacama. Thanks \nto the synergies contributed by Excon, Sany and SQM, we achieved this milestone, which is related to \nbeing the first of its kind in operation, both in SQM, Chile and Latin America. The electric machinery \nbrings different benefits such as pollution reduction and maintenance time reduction, since it \nconsiderably reduces all the supplies that a diesel vehicle normally uses, such as the lubricants that ar e \nrequired for it.  \n \nWe are adding electric semi -trailers to our fleet. Randon's Hybrid R line of semi -trailers includes \ntechnology and innovation that allows recovering the energy generated during lowering and braking \nmovements. This reduces fuel costs, causing less wear and tear on components and contributing to less \nwaste generation. The semitrailers include a tank for transferring nitrate salts between the Coya Sur mine \nand the Port of Tocopilla, and a tank for transferring brine solutions at the SQM Salar mine.  \n \nAll these initiatives allow us to further deepen the company's sustainability program and, in particular, \nto come closer to meeting our aspiration to achieve carbon neutrality of our products by 2040.  \n \nIn 2023 we established a partnership with Volvo to acquire the Volvo FH Electric model, which has an \noutput of 490 kW (660 hp). These trucks are typically equipped with three electric motors and up to six \nbatteries (540 kWh). They can be charged from 1 hou r and 30 minutes to 8 hours, depending on the \nnumber of batteries and type of charger.  \n \nA fleet of 10 electric trucks from GrandLeasing was acquired by the Company under an operating lease, \nin addition to the 11 previously transferred. The vans are Maxus model T90 EV, which have an electric \nmotor that generates 130 kW of power, i.e. 174 hp. I n addition, they come with an 88.5 kWh battery \npack that allows them to travel up to 400 km according to the NEDC standard. The trucks are in operation \nat the Nueva Victoria site in the Tarapacá Region. It is worth noting that at the same site, an electro -lane \nwith charging capacity for two electric vehicles was installed at the Iris Camp, allowing a quick charge \nin two hours at full capacity.  \n \nAs part of our sustainability commitments, SQM reports in various instances to CDP, Dow Jones \nSustainability Index, SASB, Huella Chile. We report our emissions inventory, product carbon footprint, \ncorporate carbon footprint, consumption and energy, among o ther indicators. In an exercise of \ntransparency, during 2024 SQM is in the process of verifying its 2023 product carbon footprint with an \nindependent accounting firm.  \nAir quality  \nIndicator  \n1.- RT-CH-120a.1. Emissions to the atmosphere of the following pollutants: (1) NOX (except N2O), \n(2) SOX, (3) volatile organic compounds (VOC) and (4) hazardous air pollutants (HAP).  \nWe work hard to manage and monitor emissions of particulate matter PM10, we have an extensive air \nquality monitoring network in the town of María Elena, and we are part of the air quality monitoring \nnetwork in Tocopilla.  \nWith respect to the Atmospheric Decontamination Plans for PM10 at these locations, the company has \nimplemented a wide range of measures to comply with emission control and reduction commitments:  \nIn Maria Elena, since 2007 to date, we have achieved a significant reduction of PM10 emissions at the \nMaria Elena Production Plant. The reduction is the result of operational changes implemented, which \nhave allowed us to significantly improve air quality in the locality, complying with  the daily and annual \nstandard for PM10. The stations that include the Air Quality Monitoring Network associated with the  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 153 Maria Elena Decontamination Plan comply with the Annual Air Quality Standard for PM10 (50µg/m3N) \nfrom the 2010 -2012 period at the Hospital Station and at the Church Station from the 2012 -2014 period.  \nFor the city of Tocopilla, PM10 emissions generated by SQM's port operations are lower than other \nsources in the area. Within the framework of the Tocopilla Atmospheric Decontamination Plan, \ncommitments have been fulfilled and all necessary measures to mit igate emissions have been \nimplemented. During 2023, the emission of PM10 from SQM's port operations was 3.33 tons, achieving \na significant reduction in the amount of PM10 emitted compared to 2007. When comparing these results \nwith those obtained in 2022, t he reduction is still below what was committed in the Decontamination \nPlan.  \nOther Air Emissions  \nOther Emissions  Metrics  2023  2022  2021  \nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOC)  Ton 4.675,8  4.913,8  5.753,1  \nHazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs)  Ton 478,7  442,3  403,7  \nMP Ton 2.651,8  2.334,4  2.122,9  \nMP10  Ton 108,9  102,1  88,2 \nMP2.5  Ton 108,3  96,8 83,5 \nNOx  Ton 1.377,6  1.273,2  1.072,6  \nSOx Ton 1.450,5  1.448,8  1.390,1  \nNote: PM - particulate matter, NOx - nitrogen oxides, SOx - sulfur oxides.   \nDuring 2023 there was an increase in the emission of all pollutants, mainly NOx and Hazardous Air \nPollutants (HAPs). This is due to the increase in diesel oil during the period. This fuel is used in the \nMine, Leaching, Water Resources, which are the main p oints where this consumption increases.  \nEnergy management  \nIndicator  \n1.- RT-CH-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage of grid electricity, (3) percentage of \nrenewables, (4) total self -generated energy, (5) percentage of renewable energy, and (6) total self -\ngenerated energy.  \nWe use a high percentage of solar energy in our processes, which is fundamental in the productive \noperations of the solar evaporation ponds at the Salar de Atacama, Nueva Victoria and Coya Sur mines.  \nThis way of operating implies an advantage over other processes and is only possible because in the \nAtacama Desert, where our operations are located, there are the highest levels of solar radiation causing \nhigh evaporation rates, facilitating the salt conc entration processes in the ponds, during all seasons of the \nyear and continuously. Approximately 3,000 hectares correspond to solar pools that allow us to capture \nsolar energy.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 154 SQM's operations obtain their electricity from a specific contract, connected to the National Electric \nSystem and fuels, prioritizing the use of cleaner alternatives.

The project was conceived in mid 2022, which is related to the \ninstallation of 180 solar panels in the 30 parking lots for vans locat ed at Campamento Andino, which \nwill reduce 3,050 tons of CO 2 per year. Each one of these photovoltaic panels generates 540 watts of \nenergy, that is, around 20.5 megawatts per month or 245 megawatts per year; and the most relevant in \nterms of sustainability  is its great reduction in the CO footprint 2 , since for every 1 kilowatt hour \ngenerated, we stop producing 63 grams of carbon dioxide. This makes it possible to generate clean energy \nfor 10 Andino pavilions, that is, 100 rooms in these facilities are powered by the power of the \"Astro \nKing\".  \n \nRegarding its operation, the energy produced by the solar panels reaches a board located next to the \nparking lots, which then travels to a power plant called Solar Power Bank, a high -tech storage system \nthat stores and distributes the energy obtained direc tly from the sun and captured through the solar panels \ninstalled in the parking lots of Campamento Andino. It should be noted that these facilities house 36 \nlithium batteries of 5,000 watts, with an energy storage capacity of 180 kilovolts, energy that all ows \npowering the 10 aforementioned pavilions, in addition to the camp administration offices.  \n \n \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 155 Water management  \nIndicators  \n1.- RT-CH-140a.1.

Number of non -compliance incidents related to water quality permits, standards \nand regulations.  \n3.- RT-CH-140a.3. Description of water management risks and analysis of strategies and practices to \nmitigate them.  \nFor SQM, the responsible use of water is a relevant aspect of its production processes, given the scarcity \nof this resource in some places where its operations are located. We have duly authorized water use rights \nfor our operations, so we comply with all associated requirements and commitments. Likewise, we \npermanently watch over the efficient management of the water we use, and the correct water management \nof the ecosystems of origin, always favoring recirculation and optimization in the processes. In the  same \nline, we implement environmental monitoring and early warning plans to ensure the care of these \necosystems, and in our Sustainability Plan we acquired specific commitments to reduce water \nconsumption and extraction.  \nIn order to comply with our water management, we have developed the following lines of work:  \n \n \nImportant sources of water for our nitrate and iodine facilities at Pedro de Valdivia, Maria Elena and \nCoya Sur are the Loa and San Salvador rivers that run near our facilities, which have environmental \nauthorization for the extraction of surface water acc ording to the following flow rates: Maria Elena = \n62.1 l/s; Coya Sur = 90.0 l/s and Pedro de Valdivia = 94.4 l/s.  \nWater for our Nueva Victoria and Salar de Atacama facilities is obtained from wells near the production \nfacilities. In Salar de Atacama, we have environmental authorization for the extraction of groundwater \nfor a flow of 240 l/s. As part of the Sustainabil ity Plan and other commitments, this extraction has been \nlimited to a maximum of 120 l/s. This reduction of water to 120 l/s is part of the Company's sustainability \nplan. This reduction of water to 120 l/s was incorporated in the EIA \"Plan de Reducción de Extracciones \nen el Salar de Atacama\" which was submitted in January 2022 and is currently being processed.

W e have not experienced significant difficulties \nin obtaining the water necessary to carry out our operations.  \nWe permanently report to the authorities the water consumption of our production processes. We have \nno incidents of non -compliance related to permits, standards and regulations regarding water quality. In \naddition, studies are conducted to identify opportu nities for efficient use of the resource and management \nindicators are evaluated annually in each operational unit.  \nSome of our measures for the efficient use of water are:  \nRecirculation of treated water from our wastewater treatment plants to the production process. These are \nrecirculated to the process at the María Elena, Pedro de Valdivia, Coya Sur, Nueva Victoria and Salar \nde Atacama sites.  \nAt the Lithium Chemical Plant, we purchase recirculated or circular water that corresponds to 44% of \nthe plant's total water consumption, the rest corresponds to 28% of first -use water and 28% of water \nobtained from the recovery of waste solutions through the Solutions Recovery Plant (PRS), which came \ninto operation in 2023. The extraction of fresh water for production purposes is subject to strict \nenvironmental evaluations, which prevents effects on relevant environmental receptors such as \nvegetation, flor a and fauna associated with aquifers and surface water sources where the company has \nwater extraction rights.  \nIn conjunction with these studies, extensive hydrogeological modeling is designed and validated under \nthe supervision of national and international experts, from which the expected behavior of the systems \nis permanently monitored.  \nOf the total subway resources extracted for Nueva Victoria during 2023, 1,071,084 m3 were reinjected, \nas part of the mitigation measure contemplated by the Pampa Hermosa project in the Salar de Llamara, \nTarapacá Region.  \nWater Resources and Sustainability Plan  \nWe are committed to reducing our inland water consumption, aiming for a 40% reduction by 2030 and \na 65% reduction by 2040. At Salar de Atacama, water consumption has been reduced by 50% from 2021 \nand we estimate that it will remain at half of the environme ntally approved level until 2030.  \n \nAs of November 2020, we reduced our brine extraction by 25% and will progress to reduce brine \nextraction by 50% by 2028, as committed in the Environmental Impact Study \"Plan to Reduce Extraction \nin the Salar de Atacama\", presented at the beginning of 2022.   \n \nWater consumption intensity reduction of 2.9% for potassium chloride  \n \nWe have the portal https://www.sqmsenlinea.com/  or Online Monitoring in the Salar de Atacama, which \ncommunicates the environmental information of our operation in the Salar de Atacama to communities \nand stakeholders. We have designed and implemented a system that provides information on our water \nextra ction, net brine extraction, and functions as a means of verification for authorities and stakeholders \nregarding compliance with extraction obligations, based on established operational rules. It also provides \ndata from the historical records of the enviro nmental monitoring we carry out in the area, to evaluate and  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 157 avoid potential effects of our operation, other actors and natural phenomena such as climate change in \nthe protection zones.  \nWe expect to soon enable a similar platform that will allow us to report on these variables associated \nwith our Nueva Victoria operation.  \nWater Extraction and Consumption  \nRanking  Type  Metrics  Average \nTDS \nquality \n(mg/l)  Location \nExtraction  2023  2022  2021  \nSurface \nWater  Salt \nWater  m3 >1000  Loa River, \nSalvador \nRiver  6.151.672  6.311.835  6.525.669  \nGroundwater  Salt \nWater  m3 >1000  Pampa del \nTamarugal/ \nSalar de \nAtacama \nAquifer  22.029.049  21.961.378  23.749.455  \nThird Party \nWater  Fresh \nWater  m3 <1000  Produced by \nTercero  1.897.646  2.000.340  1.610.488  \nTotal water withdrawn  m3 30.078.367  30.273.553  31.885.612  \nTotal water consumed  m3 29.007.283  29.377.645  31.007.776  \nWater Extracted from High or Extremely High \nWater Stress Zones  % 100%  100%  100%  \nWater Consumed from High or Extremely High \nWater Stress Areas  % 96% 97% 99% \n \nTo optimize water consumption, we take waste and treated water from our sewage treatment plants and \nrecirculate it in the production process. Water reused during 2023 is approximately 1,110,319 m3 , \ncorresponding to an operational estimate.  \nThe Salar de Atacama operation has been implementing the \"Industrial Water Optimization\" initiative, \nwhich shows the actions we are carrying out in our operations in favor of sustainable and environmentally \nfriendly development. The third Fundamental Sustainability Standard addresses the efficient use of \nwater, which is why it is necessary to guarantee processes that allow it to be used efficiently. Based on \nthis, since 2020 a system has been implemented which seeks to generate an improvement regarding \nindustrial water consumption and those imbalances produced in such records, promoting a more \nsustainable water extraction and consumption. As a result, it has been possible to red uce an important \nvolume of extraction and optimize the use of industrial water, with actions such as:  \n• Analysis of water consumption in the different production areas.  \n• The creation of the \"Industrial Water Supply Report\" for each area of Salar de Atacama, in order \nto monitor and control the processes and operations that use this resource.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 158 • The \"Static Supply\" was changed to a \"Daily Industrial Water Supply\" for the day and night \nshifts, as a way of adapting to the variations of the operation.  \n• A \"Plant Detention Standard\" was created, in which the detention time and release of cubic \nmeters of water must be reported, in order to use it and make an industrial water supply for \ncritical areas, such as Wells and Services.  \n• Implementation of the \"Daily Industrial Water Consumption Report\", which -through an \nautomated dashboard - allows tracking of daily extraction, industrial water pool levels, daily \nconsumption compared to water offers, a daily and weekly detail of consumptio n by area; \ncompare water extraction versus actual consumption per day.  \nRegarding risks related to our water resources, we have identified the following:  \nChanges in laws and other water rights regulations could affect our business, financial position and \nresults of operations.  \n \nWe maintain water rights that are key to our operations. We obtained such rights from the Chilean Water \nAuthority for the supply of water from rivers and wells near our production facilities, and we believe \nthat they are sufficient to meet our current oper ational requirements.  \nIn January 2022, the Chilean National Congress approved a bill that modifies the Water Code. This \namendment introduces several changes to the Water Code. One very relevant modification is the change \nin the term in which water rights are granted. According to this new legislation, water rights: (i) will \nhave a temporary nature being granted for a maximum of 30 years (the specific term will depend on the \ncharacteristics of the watercourse and its water availability); (ii) will be subject - totally or partiall y - to \nexpiration for non -use; (iii) must comply with human consumption and sanitation as a priority in the use \nof water; and (iv) will be subject to a minimum ecological flow to ensure nature conservation and \nenvironmental protection, as determined by the  General Water Directorate.  \nOur water supply could be affected by geological changes or climate change.  \n \nOur access to water can be affected by changes in geology, climate change or other natural factors, such \nas the drying up of wells or reductions in the amount of water available in the wells or rivers from which \nwe obtain water, which we cannot control.  \n \nThe use of seawater for future or current operations could increase our operating costs. Any such change \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nTo mitigate our water -related risks, we have rigorous environmental monitoring plans that allow us to \nidentify any possible deviations from what has been assessed, including the extraction of water from \npumping wells to ensure operational continuity.  \nIn addition, risks are reviewed and evaluated from time to time in order to define strategies to mitigate \nrisks. We also have a Sustainability Management, who are in charge of defining the company's goals in \nterms of reducing water consumption, and Environ mental Management, who are in charge of verifying \ncompliance with the established limits.  \n \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 159 Hazardous waste management  \nIndicator  \n1.- RT-CH-150a.1. Quantity of hazardous waste generated, percentage recycled  \nAt SQM we are aware that one way to mitigate impacts on our environment is the efficient management \nof our waste. We manage our waste in accordance with national legislation, our environmental \ncommitments, and in line with industry best practices.  \nWe aim at an adequate management, minimizing their generation, valuing them and looking for a new \nuse or an adequate final disposal, thus reducing the risk to human health, the environment and the \ncommunities. In this way, the work axes correspond to:  \n \nWe generate different types of waste, such as:  \n• Domestic or similar waste : from the use of offices, dining rooms, bathrooms, among others.  \n• Non-hazardous industrial waste : wood, HDPE, scrap metal, debris, plastics, among others.  \n• Hazardous industrial waste: from inputs that are hazardous in nature, and their residues or \nelements contaminated with them have characteristics in accordance with the provisions of \nArticle 11 of S.D. 148/04.  \n \nWaste management is a fundamental task for our company, and we take the necessary measures to ensure \nthat it is carried out safely. Waste declarations are made in the Single Window system, which correspond \nto: \n• Non-hazardous waste is declared monthly in SINADER to report to the environmental authority \nthe amount of waste leaving the industrial site, which is validated by the recipient.  \n• In SIDREP, hazardous waste is declared each time it is required, that is, each time a truck leaves, \nthis document is generated through the one -stop portal to be delivered to the transporter. In this \ncase, it is the transporter and the final disposal that v alidate the information we generate.  \nAll companies that transport and dispose of waste have the corresponding authorizations.  \nWe have developed hazardous and non -hazardous waste management plans and procedures. We have 8 \nwarehouses for the temporary storage of hazardous waste authorized by the Secretaría Regional \nMinisterial de Salud, 6 authorized warehouses for the temporary sto rage of non -hazardous industrial \nwaste, and a place for the disposal of domestic waste generated by our operations.  \nInternal control is carried out by the operational area that manages waste collection and by the \nenvironmental compliance area. We verify that the waste arrives at its final destination by requesting \nreception tickets, and the one -stop system is used to fo llow up until the process is closed. Internal audits \nare also carried out to verify compliance with our projects and associated environmental regulations.  Continuous search for \nalternatives to minimize waste \ngeneration.Generation management under \nthe criteria of quantification, \ncharacterization, treatment and \nreduction of emissions and \nwaste, according to current \nenvironmental regulations.Quantification, segregation, \nreuse and recycling of solid \nwaste, with the aim of \nminimizing its impact and \npromoting a circular economy. \n8 INDICATORS    \n 160 98.5% of the hazardous and non -hazardous industrial waste, including domestic and/or similar to \ndomestic waste and other waste, generated by operations in 2023 was sent for final disposal in authorized \ntransports. The difference equivalent to 1.5% is recyc led or used for energy recovery. Hazardous waste \nis transported in accordance with current Chilean regulations.  \nSolid domestic waste is managed at all operations and camps, and is disposed of in authorized landfills. \nDuring 2023 there was no generation of hazardous waste that was disposed of and/or treated outside \nChile.  \n \nAs a Company we seek to give priority to recycling or reuse, being our last option the disposal of waste, \nusing authorized companies for this management.  \nWaste Generation  \nTypes of Waste  Unit  Destination (on \nor off site)  2023  2022  2021  \nMining Waste       \nBatteries Sold Out  Ton Inside  27.119.868  28.203.001  33.170.650  \nDiscard salts  Ton Inside  10.714.001  11.621.008  8.106.420  \nIndustrial Waste       \nDangerous  Ton Outside  2.875  2.565  1.702  \nNon-hazardous  Ton Outside  2.387  3.856  3.718  \nDomestic and/or Domestic -\nlike Ton Outside  6.995  5.254  6.560  \nOthers  Ton Outside  212 8.502  118 \nNote: Other corresponds to mixtures of construction waste and rubble declared by Planta Química Litio.  \nThe downward trend between 2021 and 2023 in spent batteries is mainly due to the fact that various \nbatteries have been closed in previous years.  \n \nIt is worth mentioning that we have carried out several initiatives focused on improving our waste \nmanagement.  \n \nSQM Nitrates Iodine and Lithium Potassium Divisions worked together on the new roadmap that will \nallow the company to achieve circularity.  \n \nThrough workshops, the members of the different divisions met to begin to draw the first lines that will \nlay the foundations for the road to circularity. In different activities, the members of the sustainability, \nenvironment, supply, camps and M1 teams pa rticipated by presenting the most successful initiatives of \neach site, and the plan for each area regarding compliance with the sustainability goals.  \n \nDuring the activities, a summary was made of the road we have traveled in terms of sustainability since \nit became a corporate value. During the meetings, the strategic plan to increase the degree of circularity \nin the company was presented, whose main objectives are to minimize waste during the manufacture of \nour products and reduce the volumes of non -hazardous  solid waste destined for disposal in landfills.  \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 161 This roadmap will have two basic axes: the drivers, focused on the principles of circularity, and the \nenablers, which focus on the capacity to develop circularity, and the basis for a sustainable organization, \nwhose goal for 2025 is to reduce by 50% the ge neration of industrial waste in all its operations.  \n \nRegarding the treatment of our waste in the corporate offices in Santiago, in 2023, we continued with \nthe initiative that allows us to recycle paper, cans, tetrapack, plastic and glass, with the operation of \ndispensers arranged on all floors. In this way, we incorporate into our daily work the best practices \naligned with the aspiration of Sustainability, seeking to reduce waste generation, both in operations and \nin the daily workplaces.  \n \nAll of SQM's recyclable waste is taken to the Kyklos Inclusive Recycling Center, where it undergoes \npretreatment, which consists of segregating, compacting and preparing the waste for later transfer to final \ndisposal at recovery plants, which transform the  waste into new products or materials.  \n \nDuring 2023, 13 removals were made from the building's collection center, which allowed us to recover \n3,803.4 kg of waste:  \nCardboard  \n2,601.5 kg  Plastics  \n516.9 kg  Glass  \n612.5 kg  Metals  \n11.5 kg  Tetrapak  \n61 kg  \n \nWith this we have saved the following resources:  \nEnergy (kWh)  \n13.837  Trees (#)  \n44 CO 2 eq (kg)  \n3.404  Water (l)  \n68.946  \n \nEquivalent to:  \n80 months of \nconsumption of an \naverage house in Chile  737 reams of paper  267 average car days \nwithout leaving  345 average showers  \n \nAt Nueva Victoria, in addition to the process of managing and recycling domestic waste at the six green \npoints that Recipampa has, awareness -raising activities have been carried out for workers at the site \nthrough the delivery of information booklets. The Environmental Projects submanagement, together with \nthe company Recynor, held informative talks on the field with the site's personnel to inform them about \nthe proper use of the facilities and the correct segregation of waste.  \n \nThe objective was to generate awareness and optimal use of the six green points located in different areas \nof the operation and Camp Iris , which allow the collection of Pet plastics, cardboard and paper, glass and \naluminum cans, converting these materials into reusable materials through recycling.  \n \nDuring 2023, Nueva Victoria managed 1,708 kilograms of obsolete electronic waste, including \ncomputers, screens and unused telephones. This initiative was promoted by the Information Technology \n(IT) area and highlights the importance of sustainability as a corporate value. In addition, a cardboard \nrecycling campaign was implemented in the warehouse processes and in finished products, which \nresulted in the recycling of 17,132 kilograms of cardboard, thus avoiding the emission of 59,962 \nkilograms of CO 2 e into  the atmosphere. This cardboard recycling is in addition to recycling at clean \npoints.  \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 162  \nSQM's ReciPampa program recycled the following waste during 2023:  \n• Cardboard and paper: 19,502 kg  \n• Pet 1: 4,809 kg  \n• Glass: 28 kg  \n• Metals/Aluminum: 399 kg \n• Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE): 1,708 kg  \n \nIn the port of Tocopilla, a drinking fountain and filtered water filling station for reusable bottles was \ninstalled, eliminating single -use plastic bottles (REDUCE) and replacing them with refillable bottles or \ncontainers (REUSE), putting into practice 2 o f the 5Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and recover.  \n \nThis same initiative was replicated in the Land Transportation area of Coya Sur, who, in the first half of \n2023, conducted a water quality study, which included the Coya Sur, Pedro de Valdivia and the \nGuggenheim and Pampino camps in María Elena, and certif ied that the quality of the water provided by \nthe drinking fountain is safe for consumption.  \n \nThis type of initiative contributes to the reduction of plastic generated annually, mitigating the pollution \ngenerated by the decomposition of plastic bottles, which, as they degrade, generate greenhouse gases \n(methane and ethylene), in addition to the inh erent risk that plastic waste presents to the local ecosystem.  \n \nCommunity relations  \nIndicator  \n1.- RT-CH-210a.1. Analysis of participatory processes to manage risks and opportunities associated \nwith community interests.  \nThe towns near SQM's operations are small communities, which in general have an agricultural and \ntourist vocation; port in the case of Tocopilla, or mining, such as María Elena, which is a saltpeter office \ndating back to 1927, which over the years has beco me a service provider to the mining industry, and is \nnow working to become a tourist enclave.  \n \nIn 2023, SQM continued working in the Tarapacá Region locations associated with our iodine plant and \nnitrate -rich salts projects.  \n \nAs a Company, we believe that working together is an ideal form of relationship, as it has allowed us to \ncommunicate and project together with the communities prior to the presence of SQM's operation in the \narea.  \n \nLikewise, on the occasion of our Tente en el Aire (TEA) project, associated with our Nueva Victoria \noperations, we have worked in advance with the coastal coves of Iquique Chanavayita, Caramucho and \nCáñamo, where artisanal fishing, huiros harvesting and so me tourism projects are developed.  \n \nWe should point out that in the Tarapacá Region, communities and associations of the Aymara and \nQuechua ethnic groups predominate in areas close to our operations.  \n \nIn the Antofagasta Region, we have been operating for several months at Pampa Blanca, a former SQM \niodine and nitrate mine located in the Sierra Gorda district. In this context, we initiated a relationship \nwith the communities of the towns of Baquedano and  Sierra Gorda, both enclaves are characterized by  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 163 providing services to mining, and are working to generate a pole of development of astronomical tourism \nand saltpeter heritage.  \n \nSQM's operation located in Salar de Atacama, in the commune of San Pedro de Atacama, coexists \nterritorially with indigenous communities, the closest being 5 that are located south of San Pedro de \nAtacama, where the Atacameño ethnic group predominates. We c urrently have programs of shared social \nvalue, reaching 21 communities, highlighting the Alianza Mujer Atacameña program, Atacama Tierra \nFértil, dental care with a communal territorial scope and particular projects developed for and in \nconjunction with loc al organizations and communities.  \n \nLocal organization in governmental political terms is led by the Municipality of San Pedro de Atacama, \nwhich was created in 1980. In terms of organization based on ethnic and territorial relevance, it is led by \nthe Council of Atacameño Peoples, made up of 18 communities of the Indigenous Development Area.  \n \nCharacterization of the Communities  \nTarapac a Region  \nOperation  Communes/ \nLocalities  Characterization  Population  Education  \nNew \nVictory  Iquique  \nChanavayita  \nCaramucho  \nHemp  \n  \nRegional Capital, \nCapital of the \nProvince of Iquique, \nCommune:  \nPopulation: 191,468  \nDwellings: 66,986  \nMen: 94,897  \nWomen: 96,571  Population density 83.70  \nMasculinity index 98.3  \nAverage age 34.3  \nIndigenous peoples 18%  Schooling of head of household \n12.3 \nSchool attendance 95%  \nAttendance at preschool 53%.  \nAttendance at middle school \n75% \nAdmission to higher education \n38 \nCompleted higher education \n74%.  \nSchooling p. originating 10.3  \nPozo Almonte  \nLa Tirana  \nPainted  \nVictoria  \nHuatacondo  \nTamentica   \nCapital of the \nProvince of \nTamarugal, \nCommune:  \nPopulation: 15,711  \nHousing: 8,926  \nMen: 8,987  \nWomen: 6,724  Population density 1.14  \nMasculinity index 133.7  \nAverage age 32.2  \nIndigenous peoples 43%.

An example of this is environmental issues \nand the impact on their people.  \n• Strengthening the area of liaison and relations with the communities, having local professionals, \noffices in the territory and multiple communication channels.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 166 • Establishment of formal relationship agreements whose components incorporate human rights \napproaches, sustainability as a value, good faith and clear conflict resolution mechanisms, \nestablishment of permanent working groups.  \n \nTeamwork  \nIn order to dialogue and relate directly with the communities, we have decided to work with our own \nprofessionals, without resorting to external advisors when talking, establishing working groups, \nagreements or defining Shared Social Value Programs.  \n \nThe relationship work is promoted from offices in the territory, for direct contact with neighbors, in \naddition to other direct communication channels such as: meetings, telephone, emails, \nportaldecomunidades.sqm.com on the SQM website, applications such a s WhatsApp; complaint mailbox \ninstalled directly in the communities to raise potential risks.  \n \nWe have formed a strong community management team to establish this direct relationship with the \ncommunities, which is organized in two divisions: Corporate Affairs Management of Nitratos Yodo in \nthe case of the Nitratos Yodo Division; and the Sustainabili ty and Community Relationship Management \nof Salar in the case of the Lithium Potassium Division.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2023, the team is comprised of 38 employees, of which 21 are women and 17 are \nmen. A total of 91.9% live and work in the Tarapacá and Antofagasta Regions. We also have 15 workers \nwho belong to native ethnic groups/peoples, which are: Aym ara, Atacameño, Quechua and Diaguita.  \n \nIt should be noted that the team is made up of professionals with training in the area of social sciences \nsuch as sociology, social worker, political scientist, lawyer, administration technician, public relations, \namong others.  \n \nCommunity Management Strategy  \nOur projects seek to generate shared social value with the communities in the areas where they are \ndeveloped. Based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the United \nNations Sustainable Development Goals, and Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of \nthe International Labor Organization, SQM promotes sustainable local development and respect for the \nautonomy of communities through a permanent process of participation and dialogue aimed at achieving \nmutually benef icial agreements and the generation of plans and programs of community benefit in \npriority areas such as education, health, social inclusion, entrepreneurship, rescue of historical heritage \nand sustainable development.  \nLikewise, with a view to the joint generation of informed diagnoses regarding the possible impacts of \nour projects, we provide information in a continuous and transparent manner, and promote participation \nand consultation in all cases required by current l egislation, especially with respect to indigenous \ncommunities, guiding our actions in accordance with the principles of Convention No. 169 of the \nInternational Labor Organization and the United Nations Declaration on Indigenous Peoples. \nConsequently, we co mmit ourselves to:  \n• Promote, in accordance with current regulations, citizen participation and provide transparent \nand timely information regarding our projects, as well as periodically report on environmental \nissues.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 167 • Promote citizen participation with indigenous relevance and prior, free, informed  and good faith \nconsultation with respect to the communities potentially affected by our projects, in accordance \nwith current legislation.  \n• Respect the autonomy and traditional values of the communities where we operate.  \n• Promote and support the sustainable economic development of communities, and the generation \nof shared value projects between our operations and neighboring communities.  \n• Implement communication channels that allow for a permanent dialogue with the community, \nas well as develop effective human rights due diligence mechanisms.  \nOur management is based on two main approaches: indigenous communities and citizenship, and local \ndevelopment.  \nIndigenous Communities  \nSQM develops some of its projects in areas with a significant presence of indigenous communities, \ntaking into consideration the standards of the International Labor Organization Convention N°169, the \nSustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Dec laration on Indigenous Peoples. However, \nthese instruments may incorporate standards to which our Company does not adhere or that are not \ncurrently applicable in Chile, for example, FPIC ( Free, Prior and Informed Consent ) for all decisions \nconcerning indig enous peoples. Even so, and in accordance with best practices regarding indigenous \npeoples and the mining industry, SQM guides its relations with communities and human groups \nbelonging to indigenous peoples potentially affected by its projects within the f ramework of good faith, \nparticipation, respect for their culture and autonomy, and the search for shared value.  \nIn this sense, at SQM we aspire that our projects not only achieve environmental and social sustainability, \nbut also and especially that they promote the development of the communities and human groups \nbelonging to indigenous peoples present in their area of influence, with full respect for their rights, \nculture and territories, making the definition of indigenous peoples in the aforementioned Convention \nN°169 our own.  \nThus, SQM's focus on Indigenous Communities has as its central work axes:  \n• Informed participation, with transparency and cultural relevance.  \n• Promoting the development of indigenous communities.  \n \nCitizenship and Local Development  \nAt SQM we understand the relevance that our presence can have for the communities in the territories \nnear our production operations and facilities, so a fundamental pillar of our management is good \ncommunity relations tailored to the needs and specificitie s of each territory, in order to generate positive \nsubstantive changes in the lives of the people around us. Thus, at SQM, community relations are \naccompanied by a robust program of shared social value and best practices in human rights, \nenvironmental, lab or and productive chaining, among others. We also understand the strategic role we \nplay in some of the territories where we operate in terms of structural support, and we assume this \nresponsibility as a daily challenge for the inhabitants of these location s. \n \n \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 168 Community Action Axes  \nIn view of the needs of the territories in which we are present, and with the experience we have in \nworking with communities, we have established four pillars of work for the Shared Social Value \nPrograms we promote, these have evolved over time, considerin g that human relations and \nenvironmental needs are changing, in addition to the natural progress of the programs and the fulfillment \nof the objectives set together with the stakeholders:  \nThe Axes:  \n \n \n \nFocusing on these axes has allowed us to strengthen our work over time and to gain experience, which \nwe apply to long -term initiatives, in which we provide tools to the communities so that they can promote \ntheir own development; we collaboratively co -const ruct our social development programs.  \n \nThis way of working has also made sense for our communities:  \n \nSocial Development: Outstanding work with farmers in the development of agricultural projects that \nconsider technology and innovation for production or safeguarding their legacy, depending on the \nlocality. In addition, we have developed projects to support entrepreneurship an d business in towns with \nmore urban characteristics, providing training alternatives or access to funds. This last aspect has been \nstrengthened in the last two years with interesting results.  \n \nEducation and Culture: It has complemented and developed programs in areas that are not being \naddressed by the public education system, especially in schools that are far from large urban centers or \nthat are multi -teacher, contributing to the quality of education. The integratio n of programs that use \ntechnology, robotics and experiential learning techniques have been crucial in recent years.  \n \nCommunity Welfare, Health and Safety:  This line of work was born at the request of communities \nthat needed support to promote sports or wellness projects in their communities, according to the \nrequirements they themselves detected. The company complemented this work with support for \ninstituti ons that promoted inclusive sports, including the promotion of women's soccer and initiatives for \nthe inclusion of people with disabilities.  \n \nAlso, within this pillar we find support for health programs, such as dental care in a mobile car, and \noperations; and support with professionals and supplies, which have been in great demand, especially \nduring the pandemic, and which we have maintained in  view of the need we have detected to bring health \ncare closer to remote places.  \n \nCultural and Historical Heritage: Heritage rescue and enhancement projects, based on Pampan roots \nor indigenous cultural legacy, depending on the locality, with presence in territories where these issues \nare not supported by other companies or the State, and the conservation of a site or c ultural aspects or \ntraditions is endangered.  \n \n \n \n Social \nDevelopmentEducation and \nCultureCommunities \nwellbeing, health \nand safetyHistorical and \nCultural Legacy \n8 INDICATORS    \n 169 Working and Liaison Tables with Communities and Multisectoral Coordination Bodies  \n \nOver the years, we have confirmed that the best instance for dialogue are the working tables, which have \ntheir own dynamics, depending on the territory and the subject that convenes them.  \n \nHowever, all of them agree that their formation must be approved by the communities. The roundtables \nare attended by representatives of the different entities, unions, associations, among others, validated by \ntheir bases; some groups include expert communi ty advisors as counterparts to the company.  \n \nAll the roundtables meet periodically and have signed memorandums of understanding, work agreements \nor operating statutes, depending on each situation. All this in order to guide joint actions between \ncommunities and the company.  \n \nAn outstanding example of this way of working is the work tables that we have established in the coastal \narea of Iquique in the coves of Chanavayita, Caramucho and Cáñamo, in advance, within the framework \nof the Tente en el Aire project, associated with ou r Nueva Victoria mine.  \n \nIn the localities of Salar de Atacama, the formal instances of working groups have made possible the \nreview of projects developed by the Company and community issues that are of high interest to the \ncommunities.  \n \nTables in effect in 2023  \n \nPresented by Commune from North to South  \nTable/ Instance/ Task  City/ Commune  Faena  \nHuara Working Table  Huara, Huara  Orcoma  \nUnder Rope Work Table  Bajo Soga, Huara  Orcoma  \nPisagua Working Table  Pisagua, Huara  Orcoma  \nRural Colonos Working Group  Colonos Rurales Sector, Huara  Orcoma  \nWorking Group of Coastal Trade Unions  Caramucho and hemp, Iquique  New Victory  \nWork Table STI N°1 Chanavayita  Chanavayita, Iquique  New Victory  \nWork Table STI N°2 Y N°4 Chanavayita  Chanavayita, Iquique  New Victory  \nWork Table STI N°3 Chanavayita  Chanavayita, Iquique  New Victory  \nWorking Table STI N°3 Caramucho  Caramucho, Iquique  New Victory  \nChanavayita  JJVV Working Table  Chanavayita, Iquique  New Victory  \nMulticultural Indigenous Multicultural Working \nGroup Tierras de Jehová Indigenous Association  Colonia Pintados, Pozo Almonte  New Victory  \nWorking Group Asociación Indígena Aymara  \nJuventud del Desierto (Desert Youth Aymara \nIndigenous Aymara Association)  Colonia Pintados, Pozo Amonte  New Victory  \nAymara Campesino Indigenous Association of the \nPampa del Tamarugal Working Group  Pampa del Tamarugal, Pozo Almonte  New Victory  \nVictoria Working Table  Victoria, Pozo Almonte  New Victory  \nHuatacondo Working Table  Huatacondo, Pozo Almonte  New Victory  \nTamentica Working Table  Tamentica, Pozo Almonte  New Victory  \nBellavista Sector Working Group  Bellavista sector, Pampa del \nTamarugal, Pozo Almonte  New Victory   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 170 Working Table with the Tocopilla Fishermen's Union  Tocopilla  Port Tocopilla  \nSurface Transportation Safety Advisory Council  Tocopilla  Port Tocopilla  \nBoard of Directors El Puerto Cowork  Tocopilla  Port Tocopilla  \nSurface Transportation Safety Advisory Council  Maria Elena/Maria Elena  South Coya  \nCommunity Security Council  Maria Elena/Maria Elena  South Coya  \nTourism Working Group  Maria Elena/Maria Elena  South Coya  \nWorking Group with the Indigenous Community  \nAymara Community of Quillagua  Quillagua/María Elena  South Coya  \nQuillagua Rural Drinking Water Working Group  Quillagua/María Elena  South Coya  \nQuillagua Hydroponic Cooperative Work Table  Quillagua/María Elena  South Coya  \nTechnical Round Table with the Atacameño \nIndigenous Community of Camar  Camar  Atacama Salt Flat  \nWorking group with the Atacameño Community of \nToconao  Toconao  Atacama Salt Flat  \nWorking table with the Atacameño Indigenous \nCommunity of Talabre  Talabre  Atacama Salt Flat  \nWorking Group with the Atacameño Indigenous \nCommunity of Socaire  Socaire  Atacama Salt Flat  \nRio Grande Working Table  Rio Grande  SQM Salar  \nWine working  table  Toconao  SQM Salar  \nMesa Mujer y Minería (with the Ministry of Mining, \nMinistry of Women and Gender Equity and Mining \nCompanies)  \n Antofagasta  Corporate Offices  \nMesa Mujer y Minería  (with the Ministry of Mining, \nMinistry of Women and Gender Equity and Mining \nCompanies)  \n Santiago  Corporate Offices  \n \nManagement Evaluation  \n \nAs part of the controls and commitments we have at SQM, all operations and expansion projects are \nenvironmentally evaluated according to the requirements of current regulations, which has considered \nmeasuring the impact of operations in neighboring localit ies;

Description of initiatives undertaken to assess, monitor and reduce exposure of \nemployees and contracted workers to long -term (chronic) health risks.  \n \nDuring 2023, part of our health and safety indicators are as follows:  \n \nTotal Recordable Incident (or Accident) Frequency Rate (TRIF)  \n \nType of Employees  2023  \nOwn Employees  0,29 \nContractors  0,07  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 178 SQM Total  0,15 \nNote: Calculation factor per 200 thousand hours.  \n \nOur mortality rate for direct and indirect employees in the reported period is zero.  \n \nThe main related hazards that have caused injuries due to accidents are: equipment and vehicle \noperations, operations with explosives, handling of hazardous substances, high temperature processes, \nintervention of energized equipment, operation of mobile eq uipment and machines, work at heights, \nlifting and hoisting operations, work in confined spaces, hot work, cross work, among others.  \n \nThe most frequent injuries related to work -related incidents and/or accidents are: contusion, burn, \nfracture, cut, sprain, irritation, among others.  \n \nThe main measures adopted to minimize risks and hazards, occupational safety incidents and accidents \nand processes are associated with:  \n \n• Eliminate exposure to fire line, improve the quality of hazard identification and risk assessment, \ninstructions and established standards; reevaluating them every time work conditions change.  \n• Unions of pressurized transfer systems must have safety devices to prevent accidental \ndisconnection.  \n• Strengthen controls that never render a security mechanism inoperable.  \n• Before driving, verify that there are no pedestrians or obstacles, drive only checked and \nauthorized vehicles, know and respect the Traffic and Transportation Regulations, carry out the \npre-use inspection (Checklist) of the vehicles or equipment.  \n• Operate equipment respecting maximum load limits.  \n• Respect the established maximum speeds, always driving at a reasonable and prudent speed \naccording to the surrounding conditions.  \n• Verify that lifting equipment and accessories are certified and inspected.  \n• Have all the appropriate personal protective equipment for working in areas and tasks involving \nhigh temperature.  \n• Isolate all energies identified at their source, check that the correct equipment and/or circuit is \nblocked, check that the energy of the circuit to be intervened is at zero and that there is no \nresidual energy.  \n• To know the risks and conditions for handling and storage of hazardous substances.  \n• Isolate the work area and its projection to lower levels, use tool holders to prevent them from \nfalling, carry out a pre -use inspection (checklist) of systems and equipment for working at \nheights, use certified work platforms (scaffolding, ladders, ramps, etc.).  \n• Transit through authorized places.  \n \nMore than 80% of the measures defined and implemented to manage hazards and minimize their risks \nare associated with administration, redesign and elimination controls, while the remaining percentage is \nassociated with personal protection elements, segregat ion and substitution.  \n \nThose who work in the industry may be exposed to possible contaminating agents and potential health \nrisks, elements that we seek to address in order to protect all SQM workers. We have a permanent risk \nassessment, which allows us to design measures to ensu re that our workers are in good physical and \nmental health. We have plans for monitoring, controlling and reducing exposure to all agents that our \nworkers are exposed to.  \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 179 With respect to occupational diseases in workers of contractor companies, these are managed in the Risk \nPrevention Program of our Operations (established by contract), which is aligned with SQM's Integrated \nOccupational Health and Safety Management System. In addition, we make sure that these companies \ninform their workers of their occupational risks and that they have and use personal protective equipment, \namong other things.  \n \nRegarding the exposure of our own workers and contractors to occupational diseases and pollutants (the \nlatter under OSHA) in our operations -Salar de Atacama and Lithium Chemical Plant -, the following \nhave been identified: corrosives, hepatoxins, nephrotox ins, neurotoxins, sensitizers, carcinogens, \nmutagens and reprotoxins.  \n \nThe control measures implemented to prevent exposure to the different contaminating agents are carried \nout in conjunction with the Administrative Body of the Law, in our case the Chilean Safety Association, \nACHS. Through this institution, the environmental  evaluations to which workers may be exposed are \ncoordinated, thus defining the groups of similar exposure, qualitative evaluations, quantitative \nevaluations if required, surveillance programs if applicable according to the exposure levels obtained in \nthe reports made by ACHS. Also, the implementation of engineering measures, such as, for example, \nforced extraction campaigns in laboratories, has always been favored. In the case of plants, handling is \ncarried out in open and ventilated places and always usin g the appropriate personal protection elements \naccording to the agent. In the case of respiratory protection, the technical guides of the Chilean Institute \nof Public Health and the recommendations generated in the ACHS reports mentioned above are used as \na reference.  \n \nProduct design for use -phase efficiency  \n \nIndicator  \n1.- RT-CH-410a.1.

For more details, please refer \nto Section 6.2.  \n \nManaging chemicals to protect safety and the environment  \n \nIndicators  \n1.- RT-CH-410b.1. 1) Percentage of products containing chemicals hazardous to health and the \nenvironment belonging to categories 1 and 2 of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and \nLabeling of Chemicals (GHS), 2) percentage of those products th at have been subject to a risk \nassessment.  \n \n2.- RT-CH-410b.2. Analysis of the strategy for 1) management of chemicals of concern and 2) \ndevelopment of alternatives that have a reduced impact on humans or the environment.  \n Specialty Plant \nNutritionIodine & \nDerivativesLithium & \nDerivativesPotassiumIndustrial \nChemicals \n8 INDICATORS    \n 180 We do not have a hazardous substances management procedure focused on generating alternatives that \nhave less impact on humans or the environment, given the nature and use of the products we market. \nHowever, we take care to keep information on hazards and r isks of the products up to date and to have \nan updated communication of hazards through safety data sheets and labeling.  \n \nThe Company presents hazard communication information in accordance with international standards \ncommonly based on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. All \nour products have their respective safety data sheet, which i ncludes the content of the ingredients that \ncould have an impact on health or the environment. This document also presents the conditions for safe \nuse and disposal of the product.  \n \nAlso, regulatory  and technical developments are monitored for the identification of substances of very \nhigh concern according to the criteria of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006. Each raw material used is evaluated \nin terms of its hazard classification to assess the impact on th e final product classification. Safety data \nsheets are the communication tool for hazard assessment.  \n \nOur internal customers request the generation of safety data sheets for new products in an exclusive \nplatform for this purpose in order to leave evidence and support of the process.  \n \nLithium  \n \nThe Company has a graphic design and labeling update flow that establishes the inclusion of labeling \ninformation in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the destination markets:  \n \nI. Product origin, which is indicated on all labeling.  \nII. The content is indicated on a voluntary basis or when explicitly required by regulation.  \nIII. Safe use must be indicated in accordance with the relevant regulations according to the \ndestination market.  \nIV. Disposal of the product is indicated only when required by the relevant regulations.  \n \n100% of lithium products (lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate) have undergone hazard assessment \nbased on the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals \n(GHS), as well as the REACH regulation on the Registrati on, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction \nof Chemicals of the European Union, which include the Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA) and the \nChemical Safety Report (CSR).  \n \n100% of lithium -derived products have their respective safety data sheets, which are updated \nperiodically. Hazards are identified based on available scientific information obtained from the chemical \nsafety report (CSR) and are communicated through labeling  and safety data sheets. There is a permanent \nconcern to keep the communication of hazards up to date, so in 2023, 58% of the lithium safety sheets \nwere updated.  \n \n100% of lithium products are considered as hazardous chemicals for health and the environment \nbelonging to categories 1 and 2 of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of \nChemicals (GHS).  \n \nIn terms of chemical analysis, the finished lithium products do not contain SVHC - substances of very \nhigh concern - according to REACH; nor chemicals classified as extremely hazardous or highly \nhazardous by the WHO. Lithium carbonate is listed in Californ ia's Proposition 65, with no particular \nanalysis related to this regulation in 2023.  \n  \n8 INDICATORS    \n 181 There is no management system for substances of concern focused on generating product alternatives \nthat have less impact on humans or the environment, nor is there a hazardous substances policy per se, \nbecause none of the lithium products manufactured by S QM Salar S.A. contain chemical substances of \nconcern that require the development of alternative products. However, the company is concerned about \nkeeping updated information on hazards and risks of the products. In this context, in view of the proposal \nof the European authority to classify lithium compounds as of concern, SQM has promoted the initiative, \ntogether with other lithium producing companies in the world, to carry out a more exhaustive risk \nassessment (Risk Management Option Assessment \"RMOA\") of  the entire life cycle of 4 lithium \ncompounds and thus provide the necessary information for the safe handling of our products, minimizing \nthe impact on health and the environment.  \n \nOur lithium products contain the following health and environmental hazards according to the Globally \nHarmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS): corrosive to skin and eyes \ncategory 1b or eye irritation category 2 and harmful to aq uatic organisms (short -term hazard category \n3). \n \nIt is worth mentioning that, during 2023, no cases of non -compliance with regulations or voluntary codes \nrelated to the health and safety impacts of lithium products were identified, nor cases of non -compliance \nwith regulations or voluntary codes related t o the information and labeling of lithium products.  \n \nSpecialty Plant Nutrition, Iodine, Potassium and Industrial Chemicals  \n \nSpecialty plant nutrition and iodine products play an essential nutritional role in agriculture and human \nhealth, so we do not have a hazardous substance management procedure focused on generating \nalternatives that have less impact on humans or the environ ment, given the nature and use of the products \nwe market. However, we take care to keep the information on hazards and risks of the products up to \ndate and to have an updated communication of hazards through safety data sheets and labeling. Each raw \nmateri al used is evaluated in terms of its hazard classification to assess the impact on the final product \nclassification.  \n \nSafety data sheets and labeling are the elements of communication of these hazards. Our customer service \nand/or product development team request the generation of safety data sheets for new products in a \nplatform exclusively for this purpose in order to le ave evidence and support of the process. Currently, \nour safety data sheet library has more than 4,500 documents.  \n \nThe line of specialty plant nutrition products is subject to the general controls of  \nchemicals, as well as to the sectoral regulations applicable to fertilizers.  \nIn Europe, fertilizers are regulated by Regulation (EU) 2019/1009.  \n \nGenerally speaking, chemicals marketed in Europe are subject to Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 on the \nregistration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemical substances and mixtures and \nRegulation (EC) 1272/2008 on the classification, labeling and p ackaging of substances and mixtures.  \nAdditionally, in Europe, potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate, as well as other nitrogen compounds, and \nfertilizers based on them fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/1148 on the marketing and use \nof explosives precursors.  \n \nIn the United States, fertilizers are regulated according to the provisions of each state. At the federal \nlevel, they are regulated by OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard, HCS, and the Toxic Substances \nControl Act, TSCA, and in particular potassium nitrat e and sodium nitrate are under the scope of the \nChemical Facility Anti -Terrorism Standards, CFATS. The transport of these products by sea is regulated \nby the IMDG Code and the IMSBC Code.   \n8 INDICATORS    \n 182  \n100% of the products are covered and evaluated in relation to the identification of hazards to human \nhealth and safety. The identification of these hazards is based on the criteria defined under the United \nNations Globally Harmonized System of Classificati on and Labeling of Chemicals.  \n \nIt is possible that some of our plant nutrition products may contain boron, in the form of boric acid, as \nan impurity or as a desired element. Boron levels are monitored during production. When their impurity \nor intended ingredient levels exceed the limits  based on the Globally Harmonized System, the products \nare classified as reproductive toxicants category 1B and labeled as such to communicate the hazard \nassociated with these products.  \n \nWith regard to the analysis of the strategy and methods for developing alternative processes and \nchemicals that reduce or avoid the use of substances that may be of concern to consumers, customers, \nregulators or others concerned about human health or the e nvironment, potential contaminants are \nmonitored during production and, in addition, systematic external studies are carried out for the \nevaluation of heavy metals. The company has developed products in prill form that allow reducing their \nhazard due to th e oxidizing characteristics of nitrate -based products, which is in line with the principles \nof green chemistry, designing safer chemicals.  \n \nOur iodine product contains the following health and environmental hazards according to the Globally \nHarmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS): acute toxicity category 4, eye \nirritation category 2, skin irritation category 2, STOT  SE category 3, STOT RE 1, aquatic toxicity \ncategory 1.  \n \nOn the other hand, it is worth mentioning that products classified as hazardous are subject to a chemical \nsafety assessment and, in some cases, depending on the product, a chemical safety assessment is \nperformed on their components. Products classified as non -hazardous are not subject to a chemical safety \nassessment.  \n \nNo non -compliances with regulations or voluntary codes relating to health and safety impacts of products \nand services have been identified for specialty plant nutrition products, iodine, potassium and industrial \nchemicals.  \n \nIn the case of non -compliance with regulations related to product information and labeling, the following \nnon-compliances were identified during 2023:  \n \n• Product Ultrasol 15 -5-15, California, United States, the declared nutritional content did not \nmatch what was indicated on the labeling. This was identified as a typographical error that did \nnot result in a sanction.  \n• Product Allganic 15 -0-2, California, United States, the declared nutritional content did not match \nwhat was indicated on the label. The label identification has been modified and did not result in \na sanction.  \nGenetically modified organisms  \n \nIndicator  \n1.- RT-CH-410c.1.

RISK FACTORS  \n \nRisk Factors  \nSQM's operations are subject to certain risk factors that may affect the Company's business, financial \ncondition, cash flows or results of operations. In addition to the other information contained in this \nReport, you should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks are not the only risks we \nface. Additional risks that we are not currently aware of or that we are aware of but currently believe are \nnot significant may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or \nresults of operations could be materially affected by any of these risks.  \nBusiness -Related Risks  \nThe inability to extend or renew the mineral exploitation rights related to the Salar de Atacama \nconcession, on which SQM's business is substantially dependent, beyond its current expiration date \nin December 2030, could have a material adverse effect on SQM 's business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.  \n \nOur subsidiary SQM Salar S.A. (\"SQM Salar\"), as lessee, holds exclusive and temporary rights to exploit \nmineral resources in the Salar de Atacama in northern Chile. These rights are owned by Corfo, a Chilean \ngovernment entity, and leased to SQM Salar pursu ant to (i) a mining concession lease agreement with \nCorfo, as amended from time to time, and (ii) the Salar de Atacama project lease with Corfo, as amended \nfrom time to time (collectively, \"Corfo Contracts\"). The Corfo Contracts provide for SQM Salar to (i ) \nmake quarterly lease payments to Corfo based on product sales from the leased mining properties and \nannual contributions to research and development, local businesses, communities, the Regional \nGovernment of Antofagasta and the municipalities of San Pedr o de Atacama, Maria Elena and \nAntofagasta, (ii) maintain Corfo's rights to the mining concessions and (iii) make annual payments to the \nChilean government for such concession rights. The Corfo Contracts expire on December 31, 2030. On \nDecember 27, 2023, SQ M and Codelco, the Chilean state -owned copper mining company that had been \nmandated by the Chilean government to negotiate its participation in the lithium operations in the Salar \nde Atacama, signed a non -binding memorandum of understanding (MoU), which, a mong other matters, \nestablished the framework for the terms and conditions of the definitive agreements for a joint venture \nwhereby SQM Salar may continue to exploit mineral resources in the Salar de Atacama until 2060. See \nalso \"-Risks related to Chile -The new National Lithium Strategy announced by the Chilean government \nin April 2023 has created and may continue to create uncertainty in the Chilean economy in the lithium \nindustry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business performance or t he value of our \nshares and ADSs .\" Definitive agreements are subject to negotiation and we cannot guarantee that such \nagreements will be implemented.  \n \nOur business is substantially dependent on exploitation rights under the Corfo Contracts, as all of our \nproducts originating from the Salar de Atacama are derived from our mining operations under the Corfo \nContracts. For the year ended December 31, 2023, r evenues related to products originating from the \nSalar de Atacama represented 73% of our consolidated revenues, consisting of revenues from our \npotassium business line and our lithium and period derivatives business. As of December 31, 2023, there \nare only  seven years remaining on the Corfo Contracts and we have extracted 43% of the total permitted \ncumulative extraction and lithium sales extraction limit.  \n  \nANNEXES  \n    \n193 If we are unable to reach definitive agreements with Codelco or to extend or renew the Corfo Contracts \nbeyond the current expiration date in 2030, we may not be able to continue mining lithium and potassium \nunder the Corfo Contracts, which could have a mat erial adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.  \n \nVolatility in world lithium, fertilizer and other chemical prices and changes in production capacities \ncould affect the business, financial position and results of operations . \n  \nThe prices of the Company's products are determined principally by world prices and have, in some \ncases, been subject to substantial volatility in recent years. World prices for lithium, fertilizers and other \nchemical products vary depending on the relatio nship between supply and demand at any given time. \nThe supply and demand dynamics for SQM's products are also linked to global economic cycles and \nhave been impacted by circumstances linked to such cycles. In addition, the supply of lithium, certain \nfertil izers or chemical products, including certain products sold by the Company, varies primarily \ndepending on the production of major producers (including SQM) and their respective business \nstrategies.  \n \nAs a result, the prices of the company's products may be subject to substantial volatility. For example, \nlithium prices decreased from an average price of US$52,000 per metric ton in 2022 to an average price \nof US$30,500 per metric ton by 2023. High volati lity or a substantial decline in the prices or sales \nvolumes of one or more of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \nposition and results of operations.  \n \nSales could be affected by global transportation restrictions.  \n \nWe sell our products in more than 100 countries around the world. Products are shipped in containers \nor in bulk format from the port terminals of Antofagasta, Tocopilla, Mejillones and Iquique in Chile. \nCurrent challenges in the global shipping industry ha ve led to port congestion, container shortages and \nlack of space on ships. Due to this situation, we face a risk of potential supply chain disruptions that \nmay negatively affect operations and the ability to deliver products to customers. Depending on the \nterms of shipments to customers, the risk of loss related to these shipping problems could fall on the \nCompany.  In addition, revenues and collections may also be adversely affected by significant increases \nin the cost of transportation as a result of incr eases in fuel or labor costs, increased demand for logistics \nservices, or other, and transportation delays that could have a negative impact on sales contracts and \ncustomer relationships.  \n \nSQM's sales to emerging markets and expansion strategy expose it to risks related to economic \nconditions and trends in those countries.  \n \nWe sell our products in more than 100 countries around the world. In 2023, approximately 58% of sales \nwere to emerging market countries: 44% to Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia, Japan, New Zealand, \nSouth Korea and Singapore), 7% to Latin America (excl uding Chile); 3% to Africa and the Middle East \n(excluding Israel), and 3% to Chile. Note 21.1 to the consolidated financial statements reports revenues \nfrom Chile, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and others of more than US$5.9 billion. The \ncompany ex pects to expand its sales in these and other emerging markets in the future. In addition, \nacquisitions or joint ventures may be undertaken in jurisdictions in which the company does not \ncurrently operate and which are related to any of the businesses or new businesses in which SQM \nbelieves it may have sustainable and competitive advantages. The results of our operations and our \nprospects in other countries in which we establish operations will depend, in part, on the general level  \nANNEXES  \n    \n194 of political stability, economic activity and policies in those countries, as well as the duration of the \nCOVID -19 pandemic or other pandemics. Future developments in the political systems or economies of \nthese countries or the implementation of future gov ernmental policies in those countries, including the \nimposition of withholding and other taxes, restrictions on the payment of dividends or repatriation of \ncapital, the imposition of import duties or other restrictions. In addition, the imposition of new \nenvironmental regulations or price controls or changes in relevant laws or regulations could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in those countries.  \n \nInventory levels may vary for economic or operational reasons.  \n \nIn general, economic conditions or operational factors may affect the Company's inventory levels. Higher \ninventories represent a financial risk due to the increased need for liquidity to finance working capital \nand may also imply a higher risk of product l oss. At the same time, lower inventory levels may hinder \nthe network and distribution process, affecting sales volumes. There can be no assurance that inventory \nlevels will remain stable in the future. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial position and results of operations.  \n \nNew iodine, potassium nitrate or lithium production by existing or new competitors in the markets in \nwhich the company operates could have a negative effect on prices.  \n \nIn recent years, new and existing competitors have increased the supply of lithium, iodine and potassium \nnitrate and this has had an impact on the prices of these products. Additional production increases could \nhave a negative effect on prices. There is limited information about the status of new lithium, iodine and  \npotassium nitrate production capacity expansion projects being developed by current and potential \ncompetitors and, as such, we are unable to make accurate projections about the capacities of pot ential \nnew market entrants and the dates on which they may come on stream. If these potential projects are \ncompleted in the near term, they could adversely affect market prices and our market share, which, in \nturn, could have a material adverse effect on o ur business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nWe have an investment plan that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  \n \nOur business is capital intensive. Specifically, exploration and exploitation of mineral reserves, mining \nand processing costs, machinery and equipment maintenance, and compliance with applicable laws and \nregulations require substantial capital expenditure s. Continued capital investment is necessary to \nmaintain or increase mining levels and the amount of final products the company produces. For example, \nthere is a US$2.4 billion investment plan for the years 2024 -2025. The plan will expand lithium, iodine \nand nitrate operations by accessing natural resources in both the Salar de Atacama and caliche deposits \nin Chile, as well as through the 50,000 metric tons of the Mt. Holland lithium hydroxide project in \nWestern Australia (a joint venture we are developing with our partner Wesfarmers) and in the \ndevelopment of a 20,000 metric ton lithium hydroxide production facility in China, which is fed with \nlithium sulfate from the Salar de Atacama. The plan also aims to increase mining capacity while \nprotecting the envi ronment, reducing operating costs and increasing annual nitrate and iodine production \ncapacity to meet expected growth in these markets.  \n \nDevelopment projects in the mining industry generally require several years and significant investments \nbefore production can begin. Such projects may experience unexpected problems and delays during \ndevelopment, construction and start -up. \n  \nANNEXES  \n    \n195 Our decision to develop a project is generally based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate \nthe anticipated economic returns of a project. Actual project profitability or economic viability may differ \nfrom such estimates as a result of any o f the following factors, among others:  \n• changes in tonnage; grades and metallurgical characteristics of the ore or other raw materials to \nbe mined and processed;  \n• estimated future prices of the relevant products;  \n• changes in customer demand; higher construction and infrastructure costs;  \n• the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;  \n• higher production costs; adverse geotechnical conditions;  \n• availability of adequate manpower;  \n• availability and cost of water and energy;  \n• availability and cost of transportation; fluctuations in inflation and foreign exchange rates;  \n• availability and terms of financing; and  \n• possible delays related to social and community problems.  \n \nIn addition, we require environmental permits for our new projects. In certain cases, obtaining permits \nmay cause significant delays in the execution and implementation of new projects and, consequently, \nmay require us to reassess the related risks and eco nomic incentives.  \n \nThis may require us to modify our operations to incorporate the use of seawater and upgrade our mining \nequipment and operating centers.  \n \nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production levels or generate sufficient cash \nflow or that we will have access to sufficient investments, loans or other financing alternatives to \ncontinue our activities at or above current levels,  or that we will be able to implement our projects or \nreceive the necessary permits required on a timely basis. Any or all of these factors could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nHigh raw material and energy prices could increase our production costs and cost of sales, and energy \navailability may not be available regardless of price.  \n \nThe Company depends on certain raw materials and various energy sources (diesel, electricity, liquefied \nnatural gas, gasoline and others) to manufacture its products. Purchases of energy and raw materials not \nproduced by SQM constitute a significant portio n of cost of sales (excluding payments to Corfo), which \nwere approximately 27% in 2023. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain energy at any \nprice if supplies are reduced or unavailable. To the extent that increases in energy and raw material p rices \ncannot be passed through to customers, or it is not feasible to obtain energy, the Company's business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  \n \nReserve estimates may be subject to significant changes that could have a material adverse effect on \nthe Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nEstimates of caliche ore mining reserves and brine mining reserves for the Salar de Atacama are prepared \nby qualified professionals and this information is presented in summaries of technical reports prepared \nand filed as required by subpart 1300 of Regula tion S -K.  Estimation methods involve numerous \nuncertainties as to the quantity and quality of reserves, and reserve estimates may change upward or \ndownward. A downward shift in reserve estimates and/or reserve quality could affect future production \nvolume s and costs and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.   \nANNEXES  \n    \n196  \nThe chemical and physical properties of the company's products could adversely affect their \nmarketability.  \n \nBecause SQM's products are derived from natural resources, they contain inorganic impurities that may \nnot comply with certain governmental or customer standards. As a result, it may not be feasible to sell \nthe products if it is not possible to comply with such requirements. In addition, the cost of production \nmay increase to meet such standards. Failure to meet such standards could adversely affect the \nCompany's business, financial condition and results of operations if the Company is unable to sell its \nproducts in one or more markets, or to sell to major customers in such markets.  \n \nChanges in technology or other developments could result in a preference for substitute products.  \n \nIodine, lithium and their derivatives are preferred raw materials for certain industrial applications, such \nas rechargeable batteries and liquid crystal displays (LCD). Changes in technology, the development of \nsubstitute products or other developments cou ld negatively affect the demand for these and other \nproducts sold by SQM.  In addition, other alternatives to the Company's products may become more \neconomically attractive as world commodity prices change. Any of these events could have a material \nadverse  effect on SQM's business, financial condition and results of operations.  \nWe are exposed to strikes and labor obligations that could affect production levels and costs.  \n \nWe are exposed to labor strikes and labor liabilities that could impact our production levels and costs. \nMore than 92% of our workers are employed in Chile, of which approximately 78% were represented \nby 22 unions as of December 31, 2023. A new renegotiati on cycle began in November 2023 and as of \nDecember 31, 2023, 3 collective bargaining agreements had been renegotiated. We are exposed to strikes \nand illegal work stoppages by our own workers and employees of independent contractors, which could \naffect prod uction levels, both in our own plants and in the plants of independent contractors. If an illegal \nstrike or work stoppage occurs and continues for an extended period of time, we could face increased \ncosts and even an interruption in the flow of products, w hich could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nWe are exposed to new and future labor laws and regulations in Chile, which could expose us to \npotential liabilities and costs for non -compliance.  \n \nWe are subject to recently enacted local labor laws and regulations and may be subject to new ones \ngoverning, among other things, the relationship between us and our employees and will be subject to \nnew labor bills currently under discussion in the Chilean  Congress, primarily as a result of the economic \nand political volatility and civil unrest in Chile beginning in October and November 2019. There have \nbeen changes and proposals to various labor laws including, among others, modifications related to \ntelewo rk, inclusion of workers with disabilities, minimum wage, unemployment insurance benefits, \nemployee -employer relations, pensions, profit sharing, regular working hours and other matters.  \n \nLawsuits and arbitrations could adversely affect the Company.  \n \nWe are a party to a variety of lawsuits and arbitrations involving different matters, as described in Note \n21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although we intend to vigorously defend our position, our \ndefense against these actions may not be succe ssful and responding to such lawsuits and arbitrations \ndiverts our management's attention from day -to-day operations. Negative rulings or settlements in these \nlawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of  \nANNEXES  \n    \n197 operations. In addition, our strategy to be a world leader includes entering into commercial and \nproduction alliances, joint ventures and acquisitions to enhance our global competitive position. As these \ntransactions increase in complexity and are carried out in different jurisdictions, we may be subject to \nlegal proceedings that, if resolved against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.  \n \nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with different regulatory, tax and other regimes.  \n \nWe operate in several jurisdictions with complex regulatory environments that are subject to different \ninterpretations by companies and the respective governmental authorities. These jurisdictions may have \ndifferent tax codes, environmental regulations, la bor codes and legal frameworks, which add complexity \nto our compliance with these regulations. Any failure to comply with such regulations could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nEnvironmental laws and regulations could expose the company to increased costs, liabilities, claims \nand non -compliance with current and future production targets.  \n \nOur operations in Chile are subject to national and local regulations relating to environmental protection. \nUnder such regulations, we are required to conduct environmental impact studies or environmental \nimpact statements before undertaking new projects, activities or significant modifications to existing \nprojects that could affect the environment or the health of people in the surrounding areas. We are also \nrequired to obtain an environmental license for these projects and activities. The Chilean Environm ental \nEvaluation Service, or \"SEA,\" evaluates environmental impact studies submitted for approval. The \npublic, governmental agencies or local authorities may review and challenge projects that may adversely \naffect the environment, either before these proje cts are implemented or once they are in operation, if they \ndo not comply with applicable regulations. To ensure compliance with environmental regulations, \nChilean authorities may impose fines of up to approximately US$9 million per violation, revoke \nenviro nmental permits or close facilities temporarily or permanently, among other enforcement \nmeasures.  \n \nChilean environmental regulations have become increasingly stringent in recent years, both in the \napproval of new projects and in connection with the implementation and development of already \napproved projects, and we believe that this trend is likely to c ontinue. Given the public interest in \nenvironmental compliance matters, these regulations or their enforcement may also be subject to political \nconsiderations that are beyond our control.  \n \nWe regularly monitor the impact of our operations on the environment and the health of people in the \nsurrounding areas and, from time to time, have made modifications to our facilities to minimize any \nnegative impact. Future developments in the creation or  implementation of environmental requirements, \nor their interpretation, could result in substantially higher capital, operating or compliance costs, or \nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nThe success of our current investments in the Company's operations depends on the behavior of \necosystem variables that are monitored over time. If, in future years, the behavior of these variables does \nnot comply with environmental requirements, our operat ion may be subject to significant restrictions by \nthe authorities regarding maximum allowable amounts of brine and/or water extraction. For example, on \nDecember 13, 2017, the Antofagasta Environmental Court ordered the temporary and partial closure of \ncertain water extraction wells, located in the Salar de Llamara. In October 2018, the Antofagasta \nEnvironmental Court accepted our claim and dismissed the restrictions without prejudice. It is possible  \nANNEXES  \n    \n198 that third parties may seek to reinstate these restrictions in the future. On December 26, 2019, the same \nCourt ruled that the environmental compliance plan submitted by SQM Salar S.A. with respect to the \nSalar de Atacama, which was approved by the Superin tendencia del Medio Ambiente (or SMA) in \nJanuary 2019, did not comply with certain completeness and efficiency requirements of Chilean \nenvironmental legislation.  \n \nIn September 2021, SQM Salar S.A. proposed a new environmental compliance plan to the SMA which \nwas approved by the SMA and is currently under review by the Environmental Court of Antofagasta \nafter an indigenous association filed a complaint. We believe that the proposed new environmental \ncompliance plan safeguards the protection of the environment and evaluates all courses of action \navailable under current law with respect to this resolution.  \n \nOur future development depends on our ability to sustain future production levels, which requires \nadditional investments and the submission of the relevant environmental impact studies or statements. If \nwe fail to obtain the required environmental approval s or licenses, our ability to maintain production at \nspecified levels will be seriously affected, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.  \n \nIn addition, our operations around the world are subject to local and international environmental \nregulations. Because environmental laws and regulations in the different jurisdictions in which we \noperate may change, we cannot assure you that future enviro nmental laws, or changes to existing \nenvironmental laws, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.  \n \nA significant percentage of our shares are held by two groups of major shareholders that may have \ninterests that differ from those of other shareholders and from each other. Any change in such major \nshareholder groups may result in a change of control of t he Company, its board of directors or its \nmanagement, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2023, two major shareholder groups collectively hold 47.92% of SQM's total \noutstanding shares, including 94.19% of the Series A shares, and have the power to elect six of our eight \ndirectors. In some cases, the interests of the two princ ipal shareholder groups may differ from those of \nother shareholders and from each other.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2023, our principal shareholder is Sociedad de Inversiones Pampa Calichera S.A. \nand its related companies Inversiones Global Mining Chile Limitada and Potasios de Chile S.A. \n(together, the \"Pampa Group\"), which owned 25.76% of SQM's tota l outstanding shares, as explained in \nSection 2.3 Ownership and Shares. Another significant shareholder is Tianqi Lithium Corporation \n(\"Tianqi\"), which as of December 31, 2023 owned, directly and indirectly, 22.16% of SQM's total \noutstanding shares.  \n \nThe divestiture by Pampa Group or Tianqi, or possible changes in circumstances that have led to the \nCMF's determination regarding the controlling status of the Company's shareholders, or a combination \nof these factors, may have a material adverse effect on  our business, financial condition and results of \noperations.  \n \n  \nANNEXES  \n    \n199 Tianqi is a significant shareholder and a competitor of the Company, which could create risks for \nfree competition.  \n \nTianqi is a competitor in the lithium business and, as a result of the amount of SQM shares it owns, is \nentitled to elect up to three members of the board of directors. Under Chilean law, we are restricted in \nour ability to refuse to provide information ab out us to a director of our company, which may include \ncompetitively sensitive information. On August 27, 2018, Tianqi and the Chilean antitrust regulator, the \nFiscalía Nacional Económica (FNE), entered into an out -of-court settlement, pursuant to which ce rtain \nrestrictive measures were implemented to (i) maintain competitive conditions in the lithium market, (ii) \nmitigate the risks described in the settlement and (iii) limit Tianqi's access to certain information of the \nCompany and its subsidiaries, which is defined as \"sensitive information\" in the settlement.  \n \nDuring the process of approval of the settlement agreement before the FNE, we expressed our concerns \nregarding the measures contained in the settlement agreement since, in the Company's opinion, the \nmeasures (i) could not effectively address the risks that  Tianqi and the FNE sought to mitigate, (ii) are \nnot sufficient to prevent access to our \"sensitive information\" which, in the possession of a competitor, \ncould harm us and damage the proper functioning of the market and (iii) could contradict the Chilean \nCorporations Law.  \n \nThe presence of a shareholder that is also a competitor of ours and the right of this competitor to elect \nmembers of the Board of Directors could create antitrust risks and increase the risks of an antitrust \ninvestigation against us, either in Chile or in other countries, which could have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to disruptions that carry risks of data loss, \noperational failures or the compromise of confidential information.  \n \nWe have various IT and IT tools and systems, which are analyzed prior to implementation and can add \nefficiency to business processes. The technological infrastructure is composed of the IT network and the \nOT network. These environments are separated and se gmented in order to preventively contain any \ncyber -attack or incident. In addition, both networks are protected by several layers of security and these \ncontrols help prevent the spread of cyber threats and minimize the impact in the event of an information  \nsecurity breach. However, we cannot guarantee that, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, \nour systems will not be compromised and because we do not maintain specialized cybersecurity \ninsurance, our insurance coverage for protection agains t cybersecurity risk may not be sufficient. Cyber \nsecurity breaches could result in asset or production losses, operational delays, equipment failures, \ninaccurate record keeping or disclosure of confidential information, any of which could result in busine ss \ninterruption, reputational damage, loss of revenue, litigation, fines or additional expense and could have \na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations  \n \nInternational trade tensions could have a negative effect on the Company's financial performance.  \n \nEconomic conditions in China, an important market for the Company, are sensitive to global economic \nconditions. Global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions in the past, including \nrecent international trade disputes and tariff actions announced by the United States, China and certain \nother countries. The U.S. government has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese products and, in turn, \nthe Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain U.S. -made products. There is no assurance that \nthe list of goods affected by additional tariffs will not be expanded or that tariffs will not increase \nsubstantially. We cannot predict how the policies of the Chinese or U.S. governments, in particular, the  \nANNEXES  \n    \n200 outbreak of a trade war between China and the United States and additional tariffs on bilateral imports, \nmay continue to affect global economic conditions. If the list of goods is further expanded or the tariff \nis increased, global economic conditions in b oth countries could be affected and growth in demand for \nlithium or other commodities could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.  \n \nIncreased tensions in international relations with China could result in political and economic \nmeasures against Chinese -owned companies, which could have an adverse impact on business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2023, one of our largest shareholders is a Chinese company, with a 22.16% interest \nand representation on the Board of Directors. Tensions in international relations between the United \nStates and Europe, on the one hand, and China, on the  other, have recently intensified. International trade \ndisputes and tariff actions announced by the United States, China and some other countries and other \ntrade restrictions have affected diplomatic and economic ties between the countries. This environmen t \ncould lead to political and economic measures against Chinese -owned companies. Any further \ndeterioration in the relationship between China, the United States and certain other countries may limit \nour ability to invest and develop projects in certain coun tries and adversely affect our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.  \n \nOutbreaks of infections or communicable diseases, or other public health pandemics, such as \nCOVID -19 experienced worldwide, have impacted and may further affect the markets in which SQM \noperates, and could have a material adverse effect on SQM's business o perations, financial condition \nand results of operations.  \n \nDisease outbreaks and other public health conditions, such as the global outbreak of COVID -19 \nexperienced in the markets in which we, our customers and our suppliers operate, could have a material \nadverse impact on our revenues, profitability and business.  During 2020 and 2021, the Chilean \ngovernment imposed several measures affecting our operations, including mandatory quarantines for \npeople who came in contact with infected persons, gauging restrictions, blockades in specific \ncommunities that may suffer h igher rates of infection or death, among others.  \n \nAs a precaution, our management voluntarily implemented several additional measures to help reduce \nthe rate of spread of COVID -19 in our company, including measures to mitigate workplace transmission, \nsignificant reductions in employee travel and a mandato ry quarantine for individuals who have arrived \nfrom high -risk destinations. These measures were taken based on governmental and international health \nguidelines, in accordance with the guidelines of governmental and international health organizations.  \n \nIt becomes difficult to predict the potential impact that another disease outbreak or public health \ncondition would bring on international financial markets and the potential impact on businesses, \nworkers, customers and others.  \n \nIf stakeholders and other interested parties believe that the company does not adequately address \nenvironmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) concerns, this may negatively affect SQM's \nbusiness.  \n \nIn October 2020, we announced our sustainable development plan, which includes voluntarily expanding \nour monitoring systems, promoting better and deeper conversations with neighboring communities and \nbecoming carbon neutral by 2040, and reducing water by 6 5% and brine extraction by 50% of our  \nANNEXES  \n    \n201 authorized limits. We also announced the goal of obtaining international certifications and participating \nin international sustainability indices that we consider essential for a sustainable future.  \n \nSince our sustainable development plan was announced, we have participated in voluntary assessments, \nsuch as Ecovadis, CDP Certifications, Drive Sustainability, which support our sustainable development \nplan, such as Responsible Care from the Chilean Chemi cal Industries Association, Protect&Sustain from \nthe International Fertilizer Association, Ecoports, ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 50001, and we have \nachieved the IRMA 75 level of the same standard for our operations in the Salar de Atacama, which \nseeks to promote responsible mining.  \n \nIn 2021, the Port of Tocopilla achieved Responsible Care certification, obtaining level 2 certification and \nin June 2023, the ECOSLC Foundation approved for the first time the ECOPORTS PERS Certification \nfollowing validation by the independent auditor LRQA , The Netherlands. Also, during 2022, \nResponsible Care certification of the rectified New Victoria site was achieved. The Protect & Sustain \ncertification applies to the operations of Coya Sur, Salar de Atacama, Antofagasta, Santiago and the Port \nof Tocopil la. \n \nIn terms of ISO management systems, the Port of Tocopilla obtained certification in January 2022 in the \nISO 14001 standard. We completed the ISO 14001 and 45001 recertification of our management systems \nat the Salar de Atacama and our Lithium Chemical Plan t, together with the implementation of the ISO \n50001 standard, as recommended by the certification body to certify our  \nenergy management system. We also obtained ISO 50001 certification for our Nueva Victoria, Coya Sur \nfacilities. In 2023, the Port of Tocopilla was certified by EcoPorts, a leading environmental initiative for \nthe European port sector.  \n \nDuring 2023 we participated in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) assessment and were \naccepted in the World, Emerging Markets, Mila and Chile indexes, and were included in the \nSustainability Yearbook 2024. We were assessed in the Carbon Disclosure  Project (CDP) where we \nreceived a B category climate change rating, which is above the global average (C category) and in line \nwith the global chemical industry average (B - category). We also completed the CDP assessment for \nwater in which we achieved a B - category, which is higher than the global average and the chemical \nindustry average (category C).  \n \nWhile we are dedicated to our sustainability -related efforts, if we do not adequately address all relevant \nstakeholder concerns regarding ESG criteria, we may face opposition, which could adversely affect our \nreputation, delay operations or result in threa ts or litigation actions. Failure to maintain our reputation \nwith key stakeholders and interest groups and effectively manage these sensitive issues could adversely \naffect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nClimate change and a global transition to a low -carbon economy may create physical and other risks \nthat could adversely affect our business and operations; and adverse weather conditions or significant \nchanges in weather patterns could have a material adve rse impact on our results of operations.  \n \nThe impact of climate change and climate change -driven responses, such as a global transition to a low -\ncarbon economy, on our operations and our customers' operations remains uncertain, but the regulatory \nand market risks associated with climate change, as  well as the physical risks The effects of climate \nchange could have an adverse effect on our operations, employees, communities, supply chain and our \ncustomers.   \nANNEXES  \n    \n202 Threats derived from climate include, among others, changes in regional weather patterns, including \nchanges in precipitation and evaporation parameters that, on the one hand, could intensify some \nphenomena, bringing heavy rains in short periods of time tha t generate other undesirable events that \naffect our operation and also our surrounding communities, such as road closures, infrastructure, \nlandslides, among others. In addition, rising sea levels and storm surges increase the number of days of \nport closure s that could impact the supply chain, affecting our customers and suppliers. Other events \nsuch as storm patterns and intensities, increased wind speed, heat waves, cold waves, among other events \nconsidered as acute physical risks of climate change. Other e ffects are related to temperature levels, \nincluding increased volatility of seasonal temperatures due to excessively high or low temperatures. \nThese extreme weather conditions can vary by geography and location. Historically, weather conditions \nhave caused  volatility in the agricultural industry (and indirectly on our results of operations) by causing \ncrop failures or significantly reduced yields, which can negatively affect application rates, demand for \nour plant nutrition products and the credit worthines s of our customers. Weather conditions may also \nresult in reduced acreage, flooding, drought or wildfires, which could also negatively affect farmers' crop \nyields and plant nutrient uptake, reducing the need for application of plant nutrient products for t he next \nplanting season, which could result in lower demand for our plant nutrition products and negatively \nimpact the prices of our products.  \nAny prolonged change in weather patterns in our markets, as a result of climate change or otherwise, \ncould have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  \nRisks Related to the Financial Market:  \nFluctuations in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the Company's financial performance.  \nWe transact a significant portion of our business in U.S. dollars and the U.S. dollar is the currency of the \nprimary economic environment in which we operate and is also our functional currency for financial \nstatement reporting purposes. However, a signifi cant portion of our costs are related to the Chilean peso. \nAccordingly, an increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the Chilean peso and the U.S. dollar \nwill affect our production costs. The Chilean peso has been subject to large devaluations and revaluations \nin the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. At December 31, 2023, the \nexchange rate of the Chilean peso to the U.S. dollar was Ch$877.12 to the U.S. dollar while at December \n31, 2022, the exchange rate was Ch$855. 86 to the U.S. dollar. Thus, the Chilean peso depreciated by \n2.5% against the US dollar in 2023.  \nBecause we are an international company operating in several other countries, we also transact business \nand hold assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These include the euro, the South \nAfrican rand, the Mexican peso, the Chinese yuan, the Thai baht and the Brazilian real.  \nConsequently, fluctuations in the exchange rates of these currencies against the U.S. dollar may have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.  \nWe may be subject to risks associated with the discontinuation, reformation or replacement of \nbenchmarks.  \nInterest rate, exchange rate and other types of indices that are considered \"benchmarks\" are subject to \nincreased regulatory scrutiny and may be discontinued, reformed or replaced. For example, in 2017, the \nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that i t would no longer persuade or compel banks to submit \nrates for the calculation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") benchmark after 2021 and \nLIBOR ultimately ceased publication on June 30, 2023. As was the case with LIBOR, other future \nreforms ma y cause benchmark rates to be different from what they have been in the past, or disappear \naltogether, or have other consequences that cannot be fully anticipated, which introduces a number of \nrisks to our business. These risks include (i) legal risks aris ing from possible changes required to  \nANNEXES  \n    \n203 document new and existing transactions; (ii) financial risks arising from any changes in the valuation of \nfinancial instruments linked to benchmark rates; (iii) pricing risks arising from how changes in \nbenchmark indices could affect the pricing mechanisms  in some instruments; (iv) operational risks \narising from the potential need to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational \nprocesses; and (v) conduct risks arising from the potential impact of client communication and \nengagement durin g the transition period. Various replacement benchmarks are being considered, as well \nas the timing and mechanisms for their implementation. The transition from LIBOR to risk -free reference \nrates (RFRs) requires financial firms to make a variety of interna l changes, e.g., upgrading customer \nservice and back -office systems, retraining staff and redesigning processes, as well as modifying or \nrenegotiating potentially thousands of LIBOR -linked contracts. However, discontinuing or reforming \nexisting reference r ates or implementing alternative reference rates may have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \nIn addition to financial benchmarks, there are also market benchmarks used to price our long -term supply \ncontracts, which may also be subject to regulatory scrutiny, or which may be discontinued, reformed or \nreplaced. For example, for some of our long -term supply contracts, prices reference indices prepared by \ncommodity reporting agencies such as the Shanghai Metal Market (SMM) and Fastmarkets.  \nRisks Related to Chile:  \nThe new National Lithium Strategy announced by the Chilean government in April 2023 has created \nand may continue to create uncertainty in the Chilean lithium industry, which could have a material \nadverse effect on the performance of our business or the val ue of our shares and ADSs.  \nOn April 20, 2023, President Boric announced a new National Lithium Strategy that, among other things, \nwould create a National Lithium Company (subject to the approval of the Chilean Congress), one of its \nobjectives being to provide for the participation o f the Chilean State in lithium -related activities in the \nSalar de Atacama.  \nIn connection with the announcement, President Boric provided statements regarding the following \nmatters:  \n• According to the National Lithium Strategy, Corfo would charge Codelco with leading the \nformation of the new National Lithium Company and would become its majority shareholder. \nCodelco would also be designated to lead negotiations with SQM to seek particip ation in SQM's \noperations in the Salar de Atacama prior to its expiration in 2030, as well as similar negotiations \nwith other mining companies operating in the Salar de Atacama. President Boric and Corfo have \nstated that the terms of the existing mining le ases in the Salar de Atacama would be respected \nand that any participation of the Chilean State in its operations would be with the agreement of \nthe corresponding counterparty.  \n• For areas already being developed by Codelco  and Enami (the Chilean state -owned mineral \ncompany) for lithium, new lithium exploration and exploitation contracts would only be awarded \nby the Chilean State to Codelco and Enami subsidiaries, who would decide whether or not to \npartner with private parti es for development projects. There would be a public bidding process \nfor exploration rights over unexplored areas. Any private entity seeking exploitation rights \nwould have to partner with a state -owned company that would control the project if it is decla red \nstrategic for the country . \nThere can be no assurance that the necessary elements of the National Lithium Strategy that require \nCongressional action will be approved by the Chilean Congress will be fulfilled. The new National \nLithium Strategy has created and may create uncertainty in  the Chilean Lithium Industry, which could \nimpact whether SQM will be able to participate in mineral exploitation in the Salar de Atacama beyond \nthe expiration of the Corfo Contracts in December 2030 or to what extent the Chilean State will  \nANNEXES  \n    \n204 participate in SQM's participation in its current mineral exploitation operations in the Salar de Atacama \nprior to the expiration of the Corfo Agreements in December 2030. Codelco is a new entrant in the \nChilean lithium industry and SQM has no prior experi ence in negotiating with Codelco.  \nOn December 27, 2023, SQM and Codelco signed a non -binding Memorandum of Understanding \n(MoU), which, among other matters, established a framework for the terms and conditions of the \ndefinitive agreements of a joint venture through which SQM's companies. It s subsidiary SQM Salar will \nbe able to continue exploiting mineral resources in the Salar de Atacama until 2060. Corfo granted \nMinera Tarar, a subsidiary of Codelco, the exploitation rights of the Salar de Atacama from 2031 to \n2060, which will be contribut ed to the joint venture. If the parties fail to reach definitive agreements for \nthe proposed joint venture, the Chilean government or SQM could allow the lease to expire in 2030 in \naccordance with its terms.  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues related to products from the Salar de Atacama \nrepresented 73% of our total consolidated revenues. Approximately 69% of our total consolidated \nrevenues were represented by lithium products.  \nSee \"-Risks related to our business -Our inability to extend or renew on favorable terms the mineral \nexploitation rights related to the Salar de Atacama concession, on which our business is substantially \ndependent, beyond its current expiration date in December  2030 could have a material impact. adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\"  \nBecause we are a Chilean -based company, we are exposed to political risks and civil unrest in Chile.  \nOur business, financial conditions and results of operations could be affected by changes in the policies \nof the Chilean government, by other political developments in Chile or affecting Chile and by legal \nchanges in regulations or administrative practices  of Chilean authorities or in the interpretation of such \nregulations and practices over which we have no control. The Chilean government has changed and has \nthe ability to change monetary, fiscal, social and other policies to influence the Chilean economy or \nsocial conditions. We have no control over governmental policies and cannot predict how those policies \nor governmental intervention will affect the Chilean economy or social conditions, or, directly and \nindirectly, our business, financial conditions and  results of operations. Changes in policies involving the \nexploitation of natural resources, taxation and other matters related to our industry may adversely affect \nour business, financial condition and results of operations.  \nWe are exposed to economic and political volatility and civil unrest in Chile. Changes in social, political, \nregulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, \ndevelopment and investment in Chile, as well as political crises and uncertainties in Chile, could \nadversely affect domestic economic growth. In October and November 2019, Chile experienced \nwidespread riots and mass demonstrations in Santiago and other major cities throughout the country.  \nIn December 2021, Chile elected Gabriel Boric as its new president. President Boric took office on March \n11, 2022 and his agenda focuses primarily on the elimination of private pension funds, social security \nprograms, minimum wage and pension increases, an d corporate tax increases. There is uncertainty as to \nhow President Boric's reforms may affect the political and business climate in Chile in the future; it is \npossible that these reforms could lead to higher than expected levels of inflation, unemployment , higher \ncorporate taxes and financial constraints for small and medium -sized companies, any of which could \nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nFuture adverse developments in Chile, including political events, financial or other crises, changes in \npolicies relating to foreign exchange controls, regulations and taxes, may affect our ability to execute \nour business plan and could adversely affect ou r growth, results of operations and financial condition. \nInflation, devaluation, social instability and other political, economic or diplomatic developments may  \nANNEXES  \n    \n205 also reduce our profitability. Economic and market conditions in the Chilean financial and capital \nmarkets may be affected by international events, which could adversely affect the price of our securities.  \n \nChanges to the Chilean Constitution could affect a wide range of rights, including mining rights, \nwater rights, and property rights in general, which could affect the Company's business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.  \nFollowing widespread protests and social unrest throughout Chile in October 2019, the Chilean \ngovernment introduced several social reforms and implemented a constitutional convention process to \ndraft a new Chilean Constitution to replace the current 1980 C onstitution. A national plebiscite held in \nSeptember 2022 rejected the proposed new constitution, leaving the current 1980 Constitution in place. \nHowever, broad political support for a second constitutional process prevailed, and during 2023 a second \nconst itutional convention process was implemented to draft a new Chilean Constitution.  \nThe final draft of the new Chilean Constitution approved by the Constitutional Council was submitted \nto a mandatory national referendum with an approval threshold of 50% plus one vote. This referendum \ntook place on December 17, 2023 and rejected the propos ed new Chilean Constitution by a vote of 56%. \nAs a result, the 1980 Constitution, which has been in effect since 1980, remains in force. Following the \nreferendum result, President Boric announced that there would be no further attempts to draft a new \nChile an Constitution for the remainder of his term, which ends in March 2026.  \n \nWe can give no assurance that a new constitutional reform process will not take place in the future or \nthat the social and economic concerns that led to the political and civil unrest that arose in 2019 and \nprompted the initiation of the constitutional ref orm process will be resolved or that mass protests and \ncivil unrest will not resume. The long -term effects of this social unrest are difficult to predict, but could \ninclude slower economic growth, which could adversely affect our business, results of opera tions and \nfinancial condition.  \n \nChanges in regulations relating to, or any revocation or suspension of, the Company's mining, port \nor other concessions could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.  \n \nOur mining operations, including brine extraction, are conducted pursuant to exploration and \nexploitation concessions granted in accordance with the provisions of the Political Constitution of the \nRepublic of Chile and the corresponding laws and statutes. Our exploitation concessions essentially grant \nus a perpetual right (with the exception of the rights related to our operations in the Salar de Atacama \nunder the Corfo Contracts, described above, which expire in 2030) to conduct mining operations in the \nareas covered by such concessions to the extent that we pay the respective annual patents related to such \nmining concessions. Our exploration concessions allow us to explore for mineral resources in the lands \ncovered by such concessions for a specified perio d and subsequently apply for the corresponding \nexploitation concession. Any changes to the Chilean Constitution with respect to the exploitation and \nexploration of natural resources and concessions granted as a result of the constitutional convention could  \nmaterially adversely affect our existing exploitation and exploration concessions or our ability to obtain \nfuture concessions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.  \nWe also operate port facilities in Tocopilla, Chile, for the shipment of products and the receipt of raw \nmaterials pursuant to maritime concessions granted by Chilean regulatory authorities. These concessions \nare normally renewable provided that such facil ities are used as authorized and we pay the annual fees \nassociated with them.   \nANNEXES  \n    \n206 Any material adverse change to any of these awards, any change to the regulations to which we are \nsubject or adverse changes to our other grant rights, or a revocation or suspension of any of our awards, \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations . \n \nChanges in laws and other water rights regulations could affect the Company's business, financial \nposition and results of operations.  \nWe maintain water rights that are key to our operations. We obtained such rights from the Chilean Water \nAuthority for the supply of water from rivers and wells near our production facilities, and we believe \nthat they are sufficient to meet our current oper ational requirements.  \nIn January 2022, the Chilean National Congress approved a bill amending the Water Code, which was \npublished on April 6, 2022 and enacted into law. This modification introduces several changes to the \nWater Code. One very relevant modification is the change in the term in which water rights are granted. \nAccording to this new legislation water rights: (i) will be of a temporary nature being granted for a \nmaximum of 30 years (the specific term will depend on the characteristics of the watercourse and its \nwater availability); (ii) will be subject - totally or partially - to expiration for non -use; (iii) must abide by \nhuman consumption and sanitation as a priority in the use of water (establishing orders of priority and \npossible limitations in the concession and u se of water depending on its destination); (iv) be subject to a \nminimum ecological flow to ensure the conservation of nature and the protection of the environment, as \ndetermined by the General Water Directorate; and (v) be subject to the obligation of regi stration in the \nrespective Real Estate Property Registry and in the Public Water Cadastre of the Chilean Water Authority \nand to penalties of expiration and fines in case of noncompliance. It should be noted that the regulation \nof water and its distribution  will be one of the most important axes of the new constitutional process, so \nnew changes may come into force.  \n \nChile's National Congress is considering a bill declaring lithium mining to be of national interest, \nwhich, if passed in its current form, could allow for the expropriation of the Company's lithium assets.  \nThe Chilean National Congress is currently discussing a Bill, bulletin 10.638 -08, which \"declares the \nexploitation and commercialization of lithium and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. to be of \nnational interest.\" The purpose of this bill is to allo w for the possible expropriation of our assets or our \nlithium operations in general. The bill is subject to further discussion in the Chilean National Congress, \nwhich includes several possible changes to its current wording. We cannot assure you that the b ill will \nnot ultimately be approved by the Chilean National Congress, nor that its final wording will not refer to \nus or our lithium operations. If the bill is passed as currently drafted, it could have a material adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nThe Chilean government may impose additional taxes on mining companies, which could include \nlithium mining companies operating in Chile.  \n \nThe Chilean Internal Revenue Service (\"SII\") has sought to extend the application of the specific tax on \nmining activity in Chile to the exploitation of lithium, a substance that is not concessionable under the \nlegal system, and has assessed taxes as of De cember 31, 2023 in the amount of US$986.3 million from \nSQM Salar for fiscal years 2012 to 2023 (business years 2011 to 2022). SQM Salar paid the assessed \ntaxes and filed three tax claims against the SII challenging these taxes and in two of the cases, \ncorresponding to fiscal years 2012 -2014 and 2015 -2016, the Santiago Court of Appeals declared null \nand void the first instance judgment issued by the Tax Court, in each case, ordering the reopening of the \ncase. In the third case, corresponding to the 2017 -2018  tax years, the Tax Court upheld SQM Salar's \nclaim and decreed the nullity of such assessments. This ruling was appealed by the SII and the case is  \nANNEXES  \n    \n207 currently in the Court of Appeals of Santiago, awaiting resolution. In 2023, the SII assessed differences \nfor the year 2022 with respect to the specific tax on mining activity and other adjustments for a total \namount of US$785 million, which SQM Salar inte nds to appeal within the one -year appeal period. \nAlthough the SII has not issued an assessment for the specific mining tax for fiscal year 2024 (business \nyear 2023), if the SII uses similar criteria to those used in previous years, it may issue an assessme nt in \nthe future for these tax periods, which we estimate could result in a potential assessment by the SII of \napproximately US$162.7 million (after deduction of corporate income tax), excluding interest and \npenalties. To date, we have not recorded any eff ects corresponding to the aforementioned tax \nassessments. If the SII ultimately prevails in the pending legal proceedings or continues to levy additional \ntaxes based on its interpretation of the application of the mining tax specific to lithium mining, it could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nNew legislation affecting mining licenses could adversely affect the Company's mining licenses and \nconcessions.  \n \nOn February 4, 2022, Law No. 21,420 was published in the Official Gazette, which reduces or eliminates \ncertain tax exemptions to finance a new social security support called \"Guaranteed Universal Pension\". \nAmong other changes, this law contemplates amendme nts to the Chilean Mining Code, such as (i) the \nincrease in the value of mining licenses related to mining concessions (an increase of at least 4 times the \nprevious value); (ii) the modification of the term in which mining exploration concessions are grant ed \nand the prohibition for the holder to constitute a new mining exploration concession in the same area \nonce the previous one has expired; and (iii) modifications to the process of awarding mining concessions.  \n \nRatification of the International Labor Organization's Convention 169 concerning Indigenous and \nTribal Peoples could affect our development plans.  \n \nChile, a member of the International Labor Organization (\"ILO\"), has ratified ILO Convention 169 \nconcerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. This Convention establishes several rights for indigenous \nindividuals and communities. Among other rights, the Conven tion states (i) that indigenous groups shall \nbe notified and consulted before any project is carried out on lands defined as indigenous - the right to \nveto is not mentioned - and (ii) that indigenous groups shall, to the extent possible, have a share in th e \nbenefits resulting from the exploitation of natural resources on indigenous lands. The State of Chile has \nnot defined the scope of such benefits. The State has regulated item (i) above by means of Supreme \nDecree No. 66 of the Ministry of Social Developme nt that \"Approves the Regulation that Regulates the \nIndigenous Consultation Procedure\" establishing the exercise of the right of consultation to the \nindigenous peoples that may be directly affected by the adoption of legislative or administrative measures \nand that must be carried out by the State Bodies. This regulation establishes the criteria for projects or \nactivities that enter the Environmental Evaluation System and require a process of indigenous \nconsultation. To the extent that these new rights outli ned in the Convention are translated into laws and \nregulations of the State of Chile, judicial interpretations of the Convention or of such laws and \nregulations, it could affect the development of our investment projects on lands defined as indigenous \nand such circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results \nof operations. The Chilean Supreme Court has consistently held that consultation processes must be \ncarried out in the manner prescribed by the Indigenous  Rights Convention.  \n \nThe consultation process can cause delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, including environmental \npermits, as well as public opposition from local and/or international political, environmental and ethnic \ngroups, particularly in environmentally sensitive  areas or in areas inhabited by indigenous populations.  \nANNEXES  \n    \n208 In addition, the omission of the consultation process when required by law may result in the revocation \nor cancellation of regulatory approvals, including environmental permits already granted.  \n \nConsequently, operational projects may be affected, as the omission of the consultation process, when \nrequired by law, could lead to public law nullification actions for the annulment of the environmental \npermits granted.  \n \nHowever, this risk often arises during the environmental assessment phase when environmental permits \nmust be obtained. In such a scenario, affected parties may take various legal actions to declare null and \nvoid or annul environmental permits that omitted the consultation process, and in some cases courts have \nrevoked environmental approvals where consultation was not carried out as prescribed in Convention \nn°169.  \n \nIf Agreement No. 169 affects our development plans, it could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nOur operations and projects are subject to risks related to our relationships and/or agreements with \nlocal communities and indigenous peoples' rights laws.  \nOur operations and projects are subject to risks related to our relationships and/or agreements with local \ncommunities and indigenous peoples' rights laws. Our relationships with communities located near our \noperations are essential to the success of our e xisting operations, exploration activities and the \ndevelopment of our production facilities. Failure to manage relationships with such local communities \ncan lead to local dissatisfaction which, in turn, can lead to disruptions in our operations, exploratio n \nactivities and development activities.  \nThe Council of Atacameño Peoples, representing 18 Atacameño indigenous communities, advocates for \nthe rights, traditions and interests of the Atacameño people, including land use, environmental protection \nand economic development in the Atacama region of C hile. On December 15, 2023, we signed an \nagreement with Codelco and the Organización Indígena Atacameños to include the Organización \nIndígena Atacameños in discussions regarding the extension of lithium mining in the Salar de Atacama \nbeyond 2030 through a joint venture to be formed with Codelco. However, in January 2024, a \ndisagreement within the Council of Atacameño Peoples led to the blockade of the main roads to our Salar \nde Atacama facilities for four days by a dissident group to express their disagreem ent with the non -\nbinding Memorandum of Understanding we signed with Codelco. for the operation and development of \nlithium extraction in the Salar de Atacama from 2025 to 2060. The blockade resulted in the closure of \noperations at our Salar de Atacama facil ities for one day and was quickly resolved. However, we cannot \nassure you that other disruptions of our operations in the Salar de Atacama or elsewhere by members of \nthe local communities near our operations will not recur in the future.  \nOur lease agreement with Corfo, which grants us exclusive rights to exploit mineral resources in the \nSalar de Atacama until 2030, includes a commitment to invest between US$10 million and US$15 \nmillion annually in sustainable development projects for the i ndigenous communities of Atacama La \nGrande through organizations promoting local development. We are dedicated to maintaining open and \nconstructive dialogues with local communities, mainly through roundtables.  \nDisputes with local communities living near the Salar de Atacama may in the future interfere with our \noperations and/or result in additional operating costs or restrictions and negatively impact the use and \nenjoyment of mining rights with respect to our as sets. Specific community relations challenges include \ncommunity concerns regarding the management of increased traffic, environmental impacts and resource \ndepletion, social, environmental and cultural heritage impacts, increased expectations regarding the level  \nANNEXES  \n    \n209 of benefits received by communities, benefit sharing with indigenous peoples' governments, concerns \nfocused on the level of transparency regarding the payment of compensation and the provision of other \nbenefits to affected landowners and the community at l arge. In particular, opposition by indigenous \ncommunities to our activities may require modifications to, disrupt or impede our operations, our \nexploration activities or the development of our production facilities or may require entering into \nadditional a greements with local communities, which may result in additional costs.  \nOur current and future operations are subject to the risk that one or more indigenous communities in the \nlocations in which we operate may oppose the continued operation, additional development or \nredevelopment of our operations and facilities. Claims and protests motivated by such opposition may \ndisrupt or delay activities, including permitting, at our operations and facilities. The negotiation and \nreview of agreements, including components such as business development, participation, co -\nmanagement and com pensation and other benefits, involve complicated and sensitive issues, associated \nexpectations and often competing interests. The nature and subject matter of these negotiations may \nresult in community unrest which, in some cases, may lead to disruptions in our exploration programs, \noperational activities or delays in the development of our production facilities.  \nChile has different corporate disclosure and accounting standards than those with which investors \nand the market in the United States may be familiar.  \nThe accounting, financial reporting and securities disclosure requirements in Chile differ in certain \nsignificant respects from those required in the United States. Accordingly, the information available to \nyou about us will not be the same as the informat ion available to holders of securities issued by a U.S. \ncompany. In addition, although Chilean law imposes restrictions on insider trading and price \nmanipulation, the applicable Chilean laws are different from those in the United States, and the Chilean \nsecurities markets are not as regulated and supervised as the U.S. securities markets.  \n \nChile is located in a seismically active region.  \nChile is prone to earthquakes given that it is located along major maritime -earthquake fault lines. During \n2017 -2023, Chile has experienced several earthquakes that had a magnitude greater than 6.0 on the \nRichter scale. There were also earthquakes in recen t years that caused substantial damage in several \nregions of the country. Chile has also experienced volcanic activity. A major earthquake or volcanic \neruption could have significant negative consequences for our operations and general infrastructure in \nChile, such as roads, railways, ports and product access roads. Although we maintain industry -standard \ninsurance policies, which include earthquake coverage, we cannot be certain that a future seismic or \nvolcanic event will not have a material adverse effect  on our business, financial position and results of \noperations.  \n \nRisks Related to the Company's Shares and ADSs:  \nThe price of the ADSs and the U.S. dollar value of any dividend will be affected by fluctuations in the \nexchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chilean peso.  \nTrading in Chile in the shares underlying our ADSs is conducted in Chilean pesos. The depositary for \nour ADSs will receive cash distributions from us in respect of the shares in such Chilean pesos. The \ndepositary will convert such pesos into U.S. dollars u sing the prevailing exchange rate to make dividend \npayments and other distributions with respect to the ADSs. If the value of the peso declines relative to \nthe U.S. dollar, the value of the ADSs and any distributions to be received from the depositary will  also \ndecline.  \n  \nANNEXES  \n    \n210 Developments in other emerging markets may materially affect the value of the ADSs and the \nCompany's shares.  \n \nThe Chilean securities and financial markets are, to varying degrees, influenced by economic and market \nconditions in other countries or emerging market regions of the world. Although economic conditions \nare different in each country or region, the reactio n of investors to developments in one country or region \nmay have significant effects on the securities of issuers in other countries and regions, including Chile \nand Latin America. Developments in other parts of the world may have a material effect on the Chilean \nsecurities and financial markets and on the value of our ADSs and our shares.  \n \nThe prices of securities issued by Chilean companies, including banks, are influenced to varying degrees \nby economic and market considerations in other countries. We cannot assure you that future \ndevelopments in or affecting the Chilean economy, including the consequences of economic difficulties \nin other markets, will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of \noperations.  \n \nWe are exposed to risks related to weak and volatile economic and political conditions in Asia, the United \nStates, Europe, other parts of Latin America and other nations. Although economic conditions in Europe \nand the United States may differ significantly  from economic conditions in Chile, investors' reactions to \ndevelopments in these other countries may have an adverse effect on the market value of the securities \nof Chilean issuers.  \n \nIf these or other nations' economic conditions deteriorate, Chile's economy, as a neighboring country and \ntrading partner, could also be affected and could experience slower growth than in recent years, with a \npossible adverse impact on our borrowers and c ounterparties.  \n \nThe volatility and low liquidity of the Chilean equity markets may affect the ability of shareholders to \nsell SQM's ADSs.  \n \nThe Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the principal \nsecurities markets in the United States. The volatility and low liquidity of the Chilean markets may \nincrease the volatility of the price of our ADSs  and may impair a holder's ability to sell our ADSs or sell \nthe shares underlying our ADSs in the Chilean market in the amount, at the price and at the time he \nwishes to do so.  \n \nThe share price and ADS price may react negatively to future acquisitions and investments.  \n \nAs part of our strategy as a global leader in our core businesses, we are constantly seeking opportunities \nthat will enable us to consolidate and strengthen our competitive position in jurisdictions in which we do \nnot currently operate. In accordance with this strategy, we may pursue acquisitions or joint ventures \nrelated to any of our businesses or new businesses in which we believe we can have sustainable \ncompetitive advantages. Depending on our capital structure at the time of such acquisitions or joint \nventures, we may be required to significantly increase our debt and/or equity, which will affect our future \nfinancial condition and cash flows. We may also undertake capital raises, such as the one in 2021, in \norder to raise capital for our capital plan. I n addition, any divestitures we make may not result in the \nstrengthening of our position in our core businesses as anticipated. Any change in our financial condition \ncould affect our results of operations by negatively impacting the price of our shares or ADSs.  \n \n  \nANNEXES  \n    \n211 Holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise rights under U.S. securities laws.  \n \nBecause we are a Chilean company subject to Chilean law, the rights of our shareholders may differ from \nthe rights of shareholders of companies formed in the United States and they may not be able to enforce \nor may have difficulty enforcing rights currently in effect under U.S. federal or state securities laws.  \n \nWe are an open stock corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Chile. Most of our \ndirectors and executive officers reside outside the United States, principally in Chile. All or substantially \nall of the assets of these persons are located out side the United States. As a result, if any of our \nshareholders, including holders of the Company's ADSs, wish to bring a claim against our officers or \ndirectors in the United States, they may face difficulties in initiating legal proceedings and in enforc ing \na judgment against our officers or directors in U.S. courts based on provisions of the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws.  \n \nIn addition, there is no treaty between Chile and the United States of America providing for reciprocal \nobligations in connection with lawsuits filed in their territories. However, Chilean courts have enforced \njudgments issued by U.S. courts when the Chile an court has verified that the U.S. court has respected \nbasic principles of due process and that the judgment does not contain anything contrary to the laws of \nChile. However, there is doubt as to whether an action can be successfully brought in Chile in t he first \ninstance on the basis of an obligation under the provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.  \n \nAs preemptive rights may not be available to ADS holders, they run the risk of having their holdings \ndiluted if new shares are issued.  \n \nChilean law requires companies to offer their shareholders preemptive rights whenever they issue new \nshares of capital stock so that shareholders may maintain their current percentage of ownership in a \ncompany. If we increase our capital by issuing new sha res, a holder may subscribe for up to the number \nof shares that would prevent the dilution of its interest.  \n \nIf we issue preemptive rights, U.S. holders of ADSs would not be able to exercise their rights unless a \nregistration statement under the Securities Act would be effective with respect to such rights and the \nshares issuable upon exercise of such rights, or if a registration exemption were available. We cannot \nassure ADS holders that we will file a registration statement or that a registration exemption will be \navailable. Although in connection with the 2021 capital increase, we filed a registration statement  that \nwould allow ADS holders to exercise preemptive rights, we may, in our absolute discretion, decide not \nto prepare and file such a registration statement in a future capital increase. If our ADS holders were \nunable to exercise their preemptive rights i n a future capital increase because we failed to file the \nregistration statement, the ADS depositary would attempt to sell their rights and distribute the net \nproceeds from the sale, after deducting the ADS depositary's fees and expenses. If the ADS deposi tary \nis unable to sell the rights, they would expire and have no further value, and ADS holders would not \nreceive any value from them. In any event, the ADS holders' equity interest with us would be diluted in \nproportion to the increase in our capital stoc k. \n \nIf the Company were to be classified by the U.S. tax authorities as a Passive Foreign Investment \nCompany there could be adverse consequences for U.S. investors.  \n \nWe believe that we were not classified as a passive foreign investment company (\"PFIC\" or \"PFIC\") by \n2022. Characterization as a PFIC may have adverse tax consequences to a U.S. investor holding shares \nor ADSs. For example, if we (or any of our affiliates)  are a PFIC, our U.S. investors may be subject to  \nANNEXES  \n    \n212 additional tax liabilities under U.S. tax laws and regulations and may be subject to additional reporting \nrequirements. The determination of whether we (or any of our subsidiaries) are a PFIC is made annually \nand will depend on the composition of our (or a ny of our subsidiaries') results and assets from time to \ntime.  \n \nThe receipt of dividends and distributions by ADS holders may be limited by practical considerations \nand legal constraints, which may delay the payment and receipt of dividends and distributions by ADS \nholders.  \n \nADS holders generally are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions from us on the Series B \nordinary shares held by the ADS custodian under the terms of the deposit agreement in proportion to the \nnumber of ADSs held as of the specified record d ate, after deduction of applicable fees, taxes and \nexpenses. The receipt of these dividends and distributions may be limited by practical considerations and \nlegal limitations, which may delay the payment and receipt of dividends and distributions by ADS \nholders.  \n \nChanges in Chilean tax rules could have adverse consequences for U.S. investors.  \n \nCash dividends paid by the Company with respect to shares, including shares represented by ADSs, will \nbe subject to a Chilean withholding tax of 35% withheld and paid by the Company (the \"Withholding \nTax\"). The effective rate of Withholding Tax imposed on dividends attributed to earnings in 2023 of the \nCompany and distributed during the same period was 23.90411%.  \nChanges in Chilean tax regulations could have adverse consequences for U.S. investors. For example, \nthe changes introduced by Law 21,420, published in the Official Gazette on February 4, 2022 and \neffective as of September 1, 2022, whereby the greater value  or gain obtained in the sale on the stock \nexchange or in the process of public offering of shares of corporations with stock exchange presence will \nbe considered to be affected by a single tax at a rate of 10%, except for some institutional investors, \ncould produce consequences in the taxation of U.S. resident investors.  \n \nGeneral Risk Factors:  \nMeasures to minimize bad debt exposure may not be effective and a significant increase in accounts \nreceivable, together with the financial condition of customers, may result in losses that could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the business, financial con dition and results of operations.  \nThe potentially negative effects of global economic conditions on the financial condition of our \ncustomers may include the extension of payment terms of our accounts receivable and may increase our \nexposure to bad debts. While we have implemented certain s afeguards to minimize risk, such as the use \nof credit insurance, letters of credit and prepayment for a portion of sales, we cannot assure you that such \nsafeguards will be effective and a significant increase in our accounts receivable, together with the \nfinancial condition of customers, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nQuality standards in the markets in which the Company sells its products could become stricter over \ntime.  \n \nIn the markets in which we operate, customers may impose quality standards on our products and/or \ngovernments may enact stricter regulations for the distribution and use of our products. As a result, if we \nare unable to comply with these new standards or r egulations, we may not be able to sell our products.  \nANNEXES  \n    \n213 In addition, our cost of production may increase to comply with newly imposed or enacted standards or \nregulations. Failure to sell our products in one or more markets, or to major customers, could adversely \naffect our business, financial condition and resu lts of operations.  \n \nOur business is subject to various operational and other risks, for which we may not be fully covered \nby our insurance policies.  \n \nOur facilities and business operations in Chile and abroad are insured against loss, damage or other risks \nby insurance policies that are standard for the industry and would reasonably be expected to be sufficient \nfor prudent and experienced persons engage d in business similar to ours.  \n \nWe may be subject to certain events that may not be covered by our insurance policies, which could have \na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as a \nresult of major earthquakes and unexpected r ainfall and flooding in Chile, as well as other natural \ndisasters around the world, conditions in the insurance market have changed and may continue to change \nin the future and, as a result, we may face higher premiums and reduced coverage, which could hav e a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nWater supply could be affected by geological changes or climate change.  \n \nOur access to water may be affected by changes in geology, climate change or other natural factors, such \nas the drying up of wells or reductions in the amount of water available in the wells or rivers from which \nwe obtain water, which we cannot control. Th e use of seawater for future or current operations could \nincrease our operating costs. In addition, seawater projects could face timing issues and permitting \nuncertainties that make development and construction difficult. Any such changes could have a mate rial \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \n The loss of key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business.  \n \nOur success depends in large part on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team \nand other key personnel. The loss of the services of key members of our senior management or employees \nwith critical skills could have an adverse effect o n our business, financial condition and results of \noperations. If we are unable to attract or retain highly trained, talented and qualified senior managers or \nother key personnel, our ability to fully implement our business objectives may be materially and  \nadversely affected.  \n \nSubject to Chilean and international laws against corruption, bribery, money laundering and \ninternational trade. Failure to comply with these laws could have an adverse impact on our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.  \n \nWe are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in Chile and internationally with \nrespect to anti -corruption, anti -money laundering and other regulatory matters, including the FCPA. \nAlthough we and our subsidiaries maintain policies and processes intended to comply with these laws, \nwe cannot guarantee that these compliance policies and processes will prevent intentional, reckless or \nnegligent acts committed by our officers or employees.  \n \nIf we or our subsidiaries fail to comply with any anti -corruption, anti -bribery, anti -money laundering or \nsimilar laws, we and our officers and employees may be subject to criminal, administrative or civil \npenalties and other remedial measures, which could  have a material adverse effect on our and our \nsubsidiaries' business, financial condition and results of operations. Any investigation of possible  \nANNEXES  \n    \n214 violations of anti -corruption, anti -bribery or anti -money laundering laws by governmental authorities in \nChile or other jurisdictions could result in the inability to prepare our consolidated financial statements \nin a timely manner. This could have an adve rse impact on our reputation, our ability to access financial \nmarkets and our ability to obtain contracts, allocations, permits and other governmental authorizations \nnecessary to participate in the industry and that of our subsidiaries, which, in turn, cou ld have an adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations of subsidiaries.  \n \nWe are subject to risks related to the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia may have \na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nOn February 24, 2022, Russia conducted a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing military conflict \nbetween Russia and Ukraine has provoked strong reactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, \nthe European Union and several other countries around the world, including the imposition of broad \nfinancial and economic sanctions against Russia. While the precise effects of the ongoing military \nconflict and these sanctions on the Russian and global economies remain uncertain, they have already \nresulted in  significant volatility in financial markets, as well as an increase in global energy and \ncommodity prices. If the conflict continues or escalates, markets may face various economic and security \nconsequences including, among others, supply shortages of dif ferent types, additional increases in \ncommodity prices, including natural gas, oil, fertilizers and agricultural products, significant disruptions \nin logistics infrastructure, telecommunication services, the risk of unavailability of information \ntechnology  systems and infrastructure, among others, given that Russia and Ukraine are major exporters \nof raw materials. The resulting impacts on financial markets, inflation, interest rates, unemployment and \nother issues could disrupt the global economy. Other pote ntial consequences include, but are not limited \nto, growth in the number of popular uprisings in the region, increased political unrest, especially in \nregions most affected by conflict or economic sanctions, increased cyber -terrorist activities and attacks , \ndisplacement of people to regions near conflict areas, and an increase in the number of refugees fleeing \nthrough Europe, among other unforeseen social and humanitarian effects.   \nANNEXES  \n    \n215 ANNEX 2.
